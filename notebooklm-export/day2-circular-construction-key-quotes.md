## Powerful Quotes

### Jan Thomas Odegard (Natural State / Nordic Circular Construction)

> "If we are to reach our sustainability goals, which we have to, then we really, really have to do changes in the way we do construction."

> "The Nordics are very ambitious on sustainability... But circularity in general is very low. That's among some of the lowest. So that's a bit of a challenge."

> "Until now, I haven't found one politician who can say, we're going to be this much circular in construction to achieve our climate and nature goals."

> "A traditional house in Norway is one that you can disassemble. The Danes love it as their summer house. You can pick it apart and then move it around. We have to look back to find a way for the future."

> "If we just take 10% of the big houses, where only one or two people live, and we separate small flats from them, we can have 130,000 buildings both in Norway and Denmark."

> "We have more than 200,000 unused buildings in the districts of Norway. That's a lot for a small country."

> "The regulations are being challenged, but they are still very much favoring the linear way of doing things. We need a big shift there."

### Anna Karlsdottir (Ludica Architects, Iceland)

> "For nearly 900 years we built structures that were biodegradable, required constant care, and returned to the earth when they were no longer in use. In contrast, our modern material systems are permanent, resource-intensive, and environmentally burdensome."

> "We believe that a fundamental rethink is needed in how we approach building and design. Our societal material culture has to change if we are to meet the ecological challenges of our time."

> "Innovation literally operated within a loophole."
*— On the Hamkrid hempcrete project navigating building regulations*

> "If concrete brought Iceland to modernity, what brings us into a regenerative future?"

> "Iceland sits at an interesting crossroads. Our scale makes industrial competition difficult, but it also gives us agility, proximity, and the potential for rapid systemic change."

> "Circular construction here is not only a technical challenge, but a cultural and political one."

> "The belief in unlimited growth on a finite planet is fundamentally flawed."

> "What we need is qualitative growth - a growth that regenerates rather than exploits."

### Helle Redder Momsen (Nordic Network for Sustainable Construction)

> "The most sustainable building is the one that is kept in use and loved."
*— Quoting the Beyond Zero collaboration*

> "At which pace can we consume materials which have taken billions of years to form?"

> "Circular economy is often understood as the recycling or the reuse of materials, but an important goal is to extend the lifespan of the buildings and the materials within them that we already have."

## Key Statistics Mentioned

| Statistic | Context |
|-----------|---------|
| **80% reduction** | Denmark must reduce new construction by 2030 |
| **72% reduction** | Norway must reduce material use in construction by 2030 |
| **50% circular** | Amsterdam's construction target by 2030 |
| **200,000+ buildings** | Unused buildings in Norwegian districts |
| **130,000 units** | Potential from splitting large houses (Norway/Denmark each) |
| **~80%** | Icelandic buildings made of concrete |
| **88%** | Iceland's recycling ratio for construction waste (2015-2020) |
| **95%** | Iceland's 2030 recycling target |
| **900 years** | Duration of biodegradable building traditions in Iceland |
| **15 companies** | In Nordic Circular Construction Product Catalog |

## Central Themes

### 1. The Building Less Movement
The session emphasized that the most sustainable building is often no new building at all. Denmark's "bevare eller forklare" (preserve or explain) principle and Finland's building law are codifying this approach. Adaptive reuse of existing buildings could meet housing targets without new construction.

### 2. Heritage as Innovation
Both Iceland's 900-year turf building tradition and Norway's disassemblable wooden houses demonstrate that circularity isn't new—it's ancestral. The challenge is reconnecting with lost knowledge while integrating modern innovation.

### 3. Regulatory Paradox
Regulations simultaneously block circular innovation while protecting linear practices. Iceland's hempcrete project could only proceed through a regulatory loophole, then was criticized for being too small to study—a limitation imposed by the same regulations.

### 4. Nordic Collaboration as Accelerator
Countries at different maturity levels (Netherlands leading, Greenland starting) can learn from each other. Moving together enables faster progress than isolated national efforts.

### 5. Goals Enable Policy
Without specific circularity targets, meaningful policy change remains elusive. Amsterdam's 50% circular by 2030 target shows what's possible when goals are set.

### 6. Market Development Needed
The Circular Construction Product Catalog (15 companies, scaling to 100) addresses a critical gap: property owners don't know circular solutions exist. Making alternatives visible and accessible is essential.

## The Building Hierarchy Triangle

A key framework presented by Helle Redder Momsen:

1. **Use what is already there** - for its intended purpose
2. **Prolong lifetime** - with maintenance and care
3. **Renovate and transform** - change use if needed
4. **Extend existing** - add to what's there
5. **Build new** - only if necessary (preferably with reused materials)

---

## Eight Barriers to Circular Construction

1. **Linear domination** - virgin materials cheaper
2. **Policy limitations** - no reuse requirements
3. **Public procurement** - intentions without action
4. **Immature market** - fragmented value chains
5. **Trust issues** - skepticism about circular products
6. **Low risk appetite** - conservative sector
7. **Small reuse market** - timing mismatches
8. **Slow cycles** - limited experimentation

## Nordic Maturity Assessment

| Level | Countries |
|-------|-----------|
| Pioneer | Netherlands (benchmark) |
| Leading | Denmark, Finland |
| Following | Sweden |
| Catching up | Norway, Iceland |
| Starting | Greenland |

## Nine Policy Measures Identified

1. Lifetime extension
2. Demolition prevention/criteria
3. Remove renovation barriers
4. Multi-use and efficient space utilization
5. Tax incentives
6. Design optimization
7. Design for disassembly
8. Public procurement power
9. Research and demonstration

## Call to Action

**For Policymakers**: Set specific circularity targets for construction—without goals, policy alignment is impossible.

**For Industry**: Engage with circular solutions; the Circular Construction Product Catalog makes alternatives visible.

**For Researchers**: Document and share knowledge; Iceland's lost material techniques show the cost of knowledge erosion.

**For All**: Look back to find the way forward—traditional building practices hold answers for regenerative futures.
