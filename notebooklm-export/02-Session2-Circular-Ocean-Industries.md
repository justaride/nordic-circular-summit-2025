### Key Statistics
- **23 million metric tons** of edible seafood wasted globally each year
- **45% → 90%+** fish utilization improvement in Iceland
- **$12 → $5,000** potential value increase per Atlantic cod
- **35%** of Greenland's GDP comes from Royal Greenland
- **56-66%** of shrimp historically discarded at processing

## THE 100% FISH PHILOSOPHY

### Iceland Ocean Cluster's Model

Alexandra Leeper, CEO of Iceland Ocean Cluster, shared the organization's flagship "100% Fish" philosophy:

> "We lose and waste more than 23 million metric tons of edible quality aquatic food annually. This is not only environmentally impactful, but economically wasteful."

**Iceland's Transformation:**
- Historically used only 45% of each fish's biomass (primarily fillets)
- Now more than 90% is utilized
- Every part used: fillets, heads, skins, bones, guts, blood
- Applications: food, textiles, cosmetics, biotech, biomedical

**Economic Impact:**
> "Atlantic cod has gone from a single fish worth about $12 USD to one that now has a potential value of around $5,000 USD."

### Transferable Methodology

The methodology is location-agnostic and can be applied anywhere:

1. Know what species you're landing and in what volumes
2. Understand current processing methods
3. Identify nutritional and functional properties of side streams
4. Assess market opportunities and prototype developments
5. Build business cases

> "We don't need to reinvent the wheels. Those steps and methods are really practically applicable to many other places."

## ROYAL GREENLAND: CORPORATE TRANSFORMATION

### Company Profile
- World's largest cold-water shrimp producer
- 100% owned by Greenland's 56,000 citizens
- 2,400 employees globally (1,200 in Greenland)
- Turnover equivalent to 35% of Greenland's GDP
- 38 factories in Greenland, 8 in Atlantic Canada
- 11 trawlers in fleet

### The Ilulissat Challenge

Kristian S. Ottesen shared Royal Greenland's transformation story:

- **Ilulissat factory:** 12-15,000 tons of raw shrimp annually
- **Utilization rate:** Only 34-44%
- **Problem:** 56-66% (7,000-10,000 tons) historically discarded
- **Additional challenge:** Icebergs prevent waste disposal into Disco Bay
- **Result:** Shrimp meal factory losing 800,000 DKK annually

### The 100% Shrimp Project

Through the Nordic Innovation-funded project with partners including Iceland Ocean Cluster, Primex Iceland, Stakau Denmark, Nord Fima Norway, and Nordic Marine Nutrition:

**Strategy:**
- Reduce operating costs AND increase product value
- Transform low-value shrimp meal into high-value chitosan
- Partner with Primex Iceland for chitosan retail products
- Embed circular thinking in organizational culture

**Key Learnings:**
> "We made all the mistakes you can do in a project like this. We didn't involve the right departments at the right time."

> "It's very important that factories and people who work with this daily take ownership. You can't push projects over people's heads from the main office."

**Cultural Foundation:**
> "We have a cultural way of using everything. This is naturally ingrained in Greenlandic culture to use everything we pull out of the sea."

**Result:** Loss-making operation transformed into profit center.

## HYLIA NORDIC: STARTUP INNOVATION

### The Problem

Michaela Lindström, co-founder of Hylia Nordic (Finland):

> "Why is so much seafood being wasted?"

**Processing Stage Reality:**
- 15% of global seafood wasted at processing stage
- 30-70% becomes low-value products or landfill
- Global seafood demand nearly doubling by 2050

> "If so much is being lost, we already have the future demand in our hands. We just need to utilize it smarter."

### Side Streams as Superfood

Nutritional comparison to fillets:
- **20x more calcium**
- **10x more zinc**
- **5x more collagen**
- **2x more iron**

> "Imagine eating collagen in your food instead of buying expensive pills."

### The Taste Imperative

> "It doesn't matter how good an idea it is. For consumers, it needs to taste good and have good texture. If we want people to eat side streams, they need to resemble familiar seafood."

### Hylia's Solution
- Technology transforms side streams into familiar seafood products
- 8 products launched in Finnish retail (chilled, frozen, ready meals, canned)
- Awards: UN UNIDO Global Call, Best Business Food Tech Award
- Enables seafood processors to keep value creation in-house

## CLUSTER ECOSYSTEM: THE ENABLERS

### Danish Ocean Cluster - Logistics as Leverage

Linn Indrestrand, based at Hirtshals port:

> "The solutions start with logistics and transport. It's all about volumes. Every time we move resources, quality goes down, and price goes down with it."

**Role:**
- Connect companies across energy, transport, logistics, fishing, technology
- Example: X-ray company finding bones + company extracting collagen = pan-European collaboration
- Focus on enabling, not owning

> "Ports' role is changing. We don't want to own everything. We enable and share information."

### ACT Cluster - Cross-Sectoral Innovation

Monika Poulsen, Arctic Cluster Team (Northern Norway):
- 119 partners across process industry, mining, energy, seafood, manufacturing
- 8 years of trust-building

> "Solutions lie between sectors, not within sectors. Our role is connecting companies across sectors to find resources and ideas."

**Example:** Finnfjord metal producer + University of Tromsø → Arctic algae for fish farming (entirely new value chain)

**Cluster Role:**
- Scouting and building partnerships across Arctic and Europe
- Providing arenas for companies to meet potential partners
- Long-term perspective on partnership building

> "I don't have many companies from our cluster here. They don't have time for six days for a trip to Nuuk. But I'll bring home potential collaborating partners."

### Common Themes Across Clusters

**On Trust:**
> "Building trust takes time. Once we have that trust, we make the cause bigger than any person. People deal with people."

**On Sharing:**
> "If you stop sharing, you're putting a glass bulb over yourself—the beginning of dying out. We have to pop the lids and work together."

**On People:**
> "I've had so many good ideas die because the wrong person was in the wrong chair."
