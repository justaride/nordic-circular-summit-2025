## PART 2: Purpose and Steering Group
**Time**: 10:05 - 10:10 (5 minutes)

### **Betina Simonsen** (CEO, Lifestyle & Design Cluster)

Thank you so much, Frederik, and so happy this actually could take place and also in the connection with the summit. This is perfect launch, I think.

**Background:**

We actually had a launch last year of the Nordic Textile Transition Group in Helsinki, and it was also a good momentum. But we would like to relaunch it as we have been struggling to find some finance. But then also in the meantime, we have been really happy to have this very good conversation with the Baltics. There's also now a Baltic Circular Hotspot, and we are in contact with them. We have also reached out to our really good colleagues, friends and partners in the Baltic region to discuss if this is a good idea, and I think everybody agreed.

**Purpose of the Nordic-Baltic Textile Transition Group:**

The purpose is actually to serve as a common platform where we can bring together stakeholders. It's stakeholders from:
- Companies
- Research communities
- Civil societies
- Public sector (which is also a main partner in this textile industry)

**Our Goals:**

1. **Build on knowledge** each of our countries have within this textile circular transition that we all are working on at the moment
2. **Share best and next practices** - build upon the good examples and take out the good examples so we can all learn from it and connect and inspire each other
3. **Address the systematic change** facing the textile industry with EU regulations coming up - we need to move fast and not sit in country silos doing the same cases and pilots

**Overall Theme: REDUCTION**

The overall theme, we believe, will be reduction. It is reduction of virgin materials and consumption. That is a major theme in this whole systematic textile change to a more leaner, circular industry.

**Additional Focus Areas:**
- Market failures and overlaps during transition
- How to ensure value chains are geared and updated for this major change
- Bringing together universities and R&D institutions - they have deeper knowledge and data
- Connecting the dots between stakeholders and different projects

**Steering Committee:**

We have been very happy to have a steering committee that helps us do the priorities and bring in knowledge from each of the Nordic-Baltic countries. We need to prioritize and make sure that we do the right activities and also that we are deep diving into the right themes.

I'm really, really happy and very proud that so amazing members have said yes to be part of the steering committee. We already had a really brief meeting, but also look forward to bringing the ideas and comments back to the steering committee after this session. We have really strong participants in the steering committee from each country - lots of talents and a lot of knowledge.

## PART 3: Regional Challenges and Opportunities in Used Textile Management
**Time**: 10:10 - 10:25 (15 minutes)

### **Kerli Kant Hvass** (Assistant Professor, Aalborg University; Founder, Revaluate)

Good morning, everyone from Nuuk. I am very proud to be here. And I would like to say a big thank you to LDC, Betina and Frederik for creating that opportunity to connect the textile sector upstream and downstream across the region.

We have heard over the last couple of days that working with circularity needs systems thinking, collaboration and trust. But that collaboration doesn't usually happen itself. So we need platforms and opportunities to actually meet each other, have the platform to discuss. For that reason, this is a very big milestone for the region.

**Personal Background:**

I'm Kerli, I'm from Estonia, but have lived and worked many years outside Estonia, mainly in Denmark, and have worked with textiles professionally almost 20 years. I've been part of different conversations and developments and I can see why this regional collaboration is extremely valuable to connect the dots.

I have two hats on:
1. **Assistant Professor at Aalto University** in circular economy at the Department of Sustainability and Planning
2. **Independent expert** for many years in circular transition, mainly within textile industry

My entry point to textiles was secondhand. Then I worked with brands and producers. And the last seven, eight years, mainly with the end of life value chain.

**Research Foundation:**

This work is based on my own expertise and experience from the region, but primarily on two projects that have been financed by Nordic Council of Ministers that have looked at, mainly from the circularity perspective, the post-consumer management of clothes.

**A Personal Story (2017):**

After many years of living in Denmark, I moved back to Estonia, and I was approached by one of the largest secondhand operators on the market. They had a challenge: "Kerli, we have roughly 50 tons of used textiles. We can't find markets and we send them to landfill. Can you help us?"

That problem arose because they had been collaborating with another bigger actor on the market, that they could just donate further these garments. But that bigger operator was receiving more and more from Scandinavian countries. So there was a saturation on the local market.

Then I started solving that problem, finding the markets. And I realized how complicated it was to send second-grade products out of Baltics. That project paved the way for the first Nordic Council of Ministers funded project.

**Key Findings from First Project:**

- We took the Nordic expertise and methodology, mapped the textile waste flows
- We identified hotspots
- We documented that **Baltics represent important export destination for Nordic textiles**
- We realized there is **limited collection and reuse of locally collected textiles** as a consequence of imports
- There is **high expertise in Baltics for manual sorting**, for reuse, repair and recycling

**Follow-up Project (Five Years Later):**

A lot is happening everywhere in the Nordics and Baltics - projects, as Betina also mentioned. But we also realized that there are a lot of silo initiatives and we need a better consolidated overview of what is happening and more strategic collaboration.

So that project was born with that goal. It's a small project this year, and then with a conference next summer in Riga where we also develop a report for the region - a kind of helicopter view.

**The Current Reality: Sector in Crisis**

The reality out there is quite messy. The sector is actually in crisis in many ways. And that crisis is not just that Estonia faces or Latvia faces or Denmark faces - we all face it at local, regional, EU and global level.

The overproduction and overconsumption have created a situation where end-of-life markets - reuse, sorting, recycling - there are no solutions to put through these volumes.

With separate collection of textiles from January 1st, 2025 (that all EU member countries should do), that has brought the market failures and the complexities and the lack of infrastructure and financing into the spotlight.

**Ultra Fast Fashion Challenge:**

One thing that needs to be highlighted is ultra fast fashion. In Estonia, there are now several airplanes per week arriving purely delivering Shein and Temu products. This is happening in every country. And the markets for these volumes are simply not there.

**Regional Approach - Textile as an Ecosystem:**

The textile industry works as a system and there is no country system organized within their own borders. So we need to think across borders here.

Finnish researchers, Pirjo and her colleague, have already many years ago drawn a very good visualization of textile as an ecosystem:
- **Green area**: Focusing on the product as it is - reuse
- **Blue area**: The functions of recycling

**Nordic-Baltic Mapping - Key Hotspots:**

Based on mapping we have done as part of the current Nordic-Baltic project, many of these activities are taking place in the Nordic and Baltic region:

1. **Collection**: Everybody collects now, and collection raises lots of bottlenecks and challenges

2. **Sorting for Reuse**:
   - Baltics are strong at sorting for reuse (manually, extensive expertise, lower salaries)
   - Nordics do very little sorting for reuse, majority is exported to other countries (among others, Baltics)

3. **Local Reuse**:
   - In Baltics, local reuse is higher
   - In Nordics, it's lower (in some countries it's growing)
   - EU textile strategy says reuse should be prioritized first
   - **Preparation for reuse and repair** has not received much attention
   - Research shows a lot of products don't get reused because they're dirty, have stains, have pilling - these activities are not done professionally at scale

4. **Sorting for Recycling**:
   - Automated, fiber-based sorting is taking place in Nordics (they have technology and capacity)
   - Baltics don't have that capacity

5. **Recycling**:
   - Nordics are pioneering with both chemical recycling (getting close to commercial in some cases) and mechanical recycling (piloting)
   - Baltic countries don't have that capacity

**Key Questions for the Region:**

1. Which technologies show the strongest potential for Nordic-Baltic scale-up, and what have we learned so far?
2. What infrastructure and investments are needed, and in which parts of the region?
3. Does it actually make sense regionally to set up automated sorting facilities also in the Baltics? What are the quantities?

**Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) - Opportunity or Challenge?**

All countries are now working hard to develop their own versions of the directive. EPR has a vision - stated in the law - to create an economy for collection, sorting, reuse and all these activities. The EPR should help solve the mess and chaos out there.

**Concerns about EPR Implementation:**

But if we look at what is happening on the market:
- A lot of the work being done is focusing on **price and not impact**
- Targets are **missing, unclear and unambitious**, especially for waste prevention, preparation for reuse, repair and actual reuse
- Focus should be on the whole waste hierarchy, not only recycling
- **Fees are unrealistically low** - do we actually know what are the expenses the fee should cover?
- Need for **harmonization** across borders within our own region

**Global Perspective:**

We can't deny that 80% (European numbers, Nordic-Baltic numbers are close to that) are primarily sent to or exported to Africa and Asia. So a lot of the waste hierarchy steps are not taking place in our region.

**Questions for the Group:**

1. How do we design and harmonize our EPR schemes so that they will fix market failures and enable true cross-border textile circularity?
2. How do we collaborate on data, traceability and DPP (Digital Product Passport) readiness across the region?

**Three Key Focus Areas (Nordic-Baltic Project Perspective):**

1. **Reuse, Preparation for Reuse and Upcycling**: How do we support local reuse models and professionalize preparation for reuse, but also develop scalable upcycling value chains?
2. **EPR and DPP Alignment**: Harmonization across the region
3. **Regional Infrastructure Development**: Strategic approach to sorting and recycling capacity

**Why Nordic-Baltic Collaboration?**

We do have interconnected regional value chains:
- **Nordics lead in**: Design, R&D, and emerging sorting and recycling tech
- **Baltics still have**: Production, are good at sorting manually, reuse and repair capacity

All the challenges that the textile industry is facing are common - sorting bottlenecks, contamination, volatile export markets, insufficient high-value recycling options.

**No single market has scaled feedstock volumes or technology mix available to build a circular textile system alone.**

We all need to comply and we need to comply so that the system works. Collective solutions address systemic market failures and enable circular system innovation.

**Collaboration Areas:**

This collaboration and the Nordic-Baltic platform can work on:
- Shared research and R&D
- Shared business development and piloting
- Shared standards and standard development
- Cross-border infrastructure development
- Joint investments
- Policy collaboration

Behind these big keywords, there can be lots of small and big valuable initiatives that can help the region.

**Building Trust:**

We have that platform and you can collaborate only when you have trust. Trust doesn't happen itself. So we need to have space to meet, learn about each other, understand each other, discuss the challenges and build that trust.

## PART 4: Danish Voluntary Sector Collaboration on Textiles
**Time**: 10:25 - 10:40 (15 minutes)

### **Jonas Eder-Hansen** (Senior Advisor, Lifestyle & Design Cluster)

**Introduction:**

Thanks so much, Kerli, for the insights. Great to see so many, both known and new faces. My name is Jonas and I'm really proud to be here with the Lifestyle & Design Cluster.

I'm a project manager at LDC. I recently joined LDC having 14 years of industry experience from Global Fashion Agenda, Danish Fashion Institute, as well as eight years of experience from the research side into sustainability at the Sustainability Centre at Copenhagen Business School.

**Purpose of Presentation:**

I'll give you a brief overview of the Danish voluntary sector collaboration on textiles and explain why we believe this model has a strong relevance for the wider Nordic region.

My aim today is to show how a coordinated Nordic effort could potentially speed up the circular transition and strengthen our shared position in Europe.

**Rationale for Nordic Approach:**

Many of the challenges we face in each Nordic country (and therefore also Denmark) are the same across the region. Quite a lot of companies treat our region as one integrated market.

This means a shared framework for circularity could:
- Reduce duplication
- Create common expectations
- Support international companies that operate across borders
- Strengthen our collective voice in Brussels
- Help demonstrate that our region is ready to lead on circular textiles

**Important Note:**

I want to make clear from the beginning that Lifestyle and Design Cluster will not as such initiate or drive a Nordic sector collaboration or fundraise for it directly. The purpose of this presentation is solely to inspire and invite for further exchanges, similar to the structure of the Textile Action Network led by WRAP.

**The Textile Action Network:**

We have national circularity initiatives across the UK, Canada, Switzerland, Germany, and of course us in Denmark, that connect on a quarterly basis.

**About the Danish Sector Collaboration:**

The Danish sector collaboration is inspired by what used to be called WRAP's Textile 2030, now the UK Textiles Pact.

**Key Features:**
- Brings together a broad cross-section of the Danish fashion and textile industry across different segments and categories
- Initiated back in 2022
- Includes companies working in apparel, home textiles, resale
- Represents all sizes of different companies
- It's a voluntary initiative, but signatories commit to shared goals and report on progress every year

**Purpose:**
- Create alignment across the industry
- Accelerate circularity
- Prepare companies for forthcoming European regulation

**Who Can Participate:**

All companies and stakeholders who can report data are able to join. The data reporting element is really what we are here for.

**Benefits for Participants:**
- Early warnings/preparations for legislation
- Access to comparable data and learnings from around 40 Danish signatories who've already tested what works and what doesn't work

A Nordic expansion will allow us to benchmark across markets and show policymakers that the region is serious about building a consistent and credible circular system.

**The Three Goals (2030):**

1. **Circular Materials**: By 2030, at least 40% of textiles placed on the Danish market should be made by recycled content, and at least 10% should be fiber-to-fiber

2. **Circular Design**: Products should be designed for long life and for optimal circular loops, based on a shared approach to circular design using a specific circular design guideline

3. **Circular Business Models**: A larger share of company revenue should come from resale, repair, rental, and so on that keep products in use

These goals are directly connected to European regulation and therefore also relevant for every Nordic country.

**Shared Tools and Resources:**

- **Catalogue for Recycled Materials**: Like the "yellow pages" for recycled materials
- **Design Guide**: Aligned with eco-design regulation
- **Catalogue of Service Providers**: With circular business models

With these tools, we want to make circular action practical rather than theoretical.

**Data Reporting Framework:**

Every year, we ask companies to report data on progress. There is an established reporting framework that all signatories use once a year.

This framework ensures that data is collected in a consistent format, so progress can be measured across the sector. All data is fully anonymized before it's published, which is very important for trust, comparability and participation.

**Action Plan:**

We have an action plan that guides our work towards 2030:
- Includes the three 2030 goals
- Broken down into a concrete action plan with activities and milestones
- Updated on an annual basis because regulation is evolving so rapidly
- Reflects new policy developments and new insights that keep popping up

**Steering Committee:**

Includes both companies, industry organizations, knowledge institutions, but also the Ministry of Environment and the Danish EPA are invited for these meetings.

**Call to Action:**

The Nordic countries already share a commitment to circularity and a strong tradition for collaboration. This Danish model outlined here could provide a tested framework that we believe could also be scaled to support a Nordic exchange.

Many of you in the Nordic countries have already established national initiatives, so let's really exchange and make sure that we are on this road together.

### **Betina Simonsen** (Additional Comment)

I just wanted to say thank you, Jonas, for this presentation. I'm really proud when I hear you present our sector collaboration, but also just to reinforce that this is, of course, open to Nordic and Baltic collaboration.

We are sure that this could also be interesting for the Baltic countries. In our action plan, we have put in to make sure that this experience and knowledge is given on to the Nordic. But with this collaboration with the Baltics as well, I think it's similarly important. So even when we say Nordic, we actually mean both Nordic and the Baltics, of course.

---

## PART 5: Q&A Discussion
**Time**: 10:40 - 10:50 (10 minutes)

### **Michel Bajuk** (Nordic Circular Hotspot)

**Question:** This is a great overview and well done. I'm interested in what you've learned from the work, because you have these three theme areas, and I assume you have goals on what you need to achieve. How have you done in achieving your goals? And what particular roadblocks have you found along the way? Because we have a general view, those of us who've been in the field a long time, on what the consistent problems are. Often they're not just technical, but they're economic.

### **Frederik Thrane** (Response)

I think the first thing that we learned has been that this pre-competitive setting where competing brands that would not in a million years sit together five years ago, they're actually quite willing to sit together. They're quite willing to share. They're quite aware that a lot of these challenges and obstacles ahead of them are way too big for the individual business on their own.

That to me is one of the things that I'm proudest of for the voluntary sector collaboration on textiles - that they are sitting together, they are exchanging ideas, they are quite active.

### **Jonas Eder-Hansen** (Response)

It's a long list, maybe too long for this meeting in terms of learnings. I've only been there for a year, but what I see is certainly also this important possibility to come together and work towards specific goals and really learn from each other.

**Small Pilot Projects:**

Specifically, it can be small pilot projects where two, three or four companies actually go together to specifically address issues around, let's say, how do you actually find out which products that come back - claims, returns, whatever - could potentially be repaired?

So they sit together, develop a specific system based on maybe what one or two have done already. And they try to scale that to numerous size companies, because what works for one company obviously doesn't have to work for another.

**Data Reporting:**

The second point is the whole data reporting exercise. One thing to actually get companies to report on very specific data is of course a difficult task, but once you make it easy, accessible, and of course also to some extent somehow twist a little bit an arm or two to make it happen, then you improve a framework.

We're working from the usual Excel spreadsheets that we all know into a much more consistent approach - now we use an app specifically for it and really have solid analysis based on this that we can share then with the rest of the industry, not just the signatories, but actually the rest of the industry for them to learn from the do's and don'ts based on the data.

### **Betina Simonsen** (Follow-up)

It's just very short because it's very much connected to the last point that Jonas said - the data.

The data has been really a good exercise in order to identify the data, because many of our brands have maybe not really total view of their value chain and total insight into the data and the streams of the value chain.

So that has been a really good exercise also to prepare for EPR, for example. So that's what we say - that we are preparing them for EU regulation. This has really been a good example.

### **Kerli Kant Hvass** (Response to Chat Question)

Hi Mike, you had a question in the chat about whether we have done any analysis and conclusions on the reuse and recycling potential across the region based on previous research.

The current project has quite a small budget for heavy research. Our method was that we reached out to experts in the region to consolidate what is already existing. And what we found out was quite fragmented - lots of reports.

What we have been trying to do, and the steering group members will get to comment on that, is consolidate this. But it is not so quantitative.

We also found that certain projects were done a few years ago that tried to map these flows and calculate the potential. But these methods that have been used and the work that has been done, it does sit in many, many reports. So we don't have that consolidated, excellent overview.

But this is also something that the steering group can actually look into. And we can discuss how do we build collectively on what is already out there, but also what the Nordic-Baltic helicopter view has found out and how do we consolidate these numbers.

One thing along the way - we also found synergies with a project called **Textended**, which is an EU Horizon project that has some budget allocated for collecting additional data. So we will do that in spring.

---

## PART 6: Next Steps and Timeline
**Time**: 10:50 - 10:55 (5 minutes)

### **Betina Simonsen**

In the steering committee meeting we had prior to this meeting, we have discussed what should be the format of this Nordic-Baltic Textile Transition Group.

**Proposed Format:**

1. **Two open online seminars/webinars/conferences/conversations** where we meet on specific themes

2. **One physical event** that we will lean into - we will not try to do our own physical event because so much is happening around the Baltic and Nordics, but we will actually attach ourselves to a really important event going on in the Baltic-Nordic region to meet physically, because we believe that physical meetings are important

**Host Country Model:**

We had an idea that when we meet, one country will be kind of the host, where they will be deep diving a little bit more into their initiatives, their pilots, some research results that's been done. So they have a bit more time to elaborate on their experiences to exchange with the rest of us.

**Theme Prioritization:**

With the themes you are bringing in, we will also prioritize an overall theme for each of these meetings with the steering committee.

### **Steering Group Member** (Supporting Comment)

I absolutely agree. I really, really am in with the physical meetings because as Michael already mentioned, it's so nice, so good to raise your hand physically. So it is really good to see each other and share the knowledge and share the experience.

And I really love the idea that we are digging into the country we are visiting too. So it was a great idea.

---

## PART 7: Brainstorming and Closing
**Time**: 10:55 - 11:00 (5 minutes)

### **Frederik Thrane** (Facilitating)

We should spend the remainder of our time to talk about ideas and what activities and topics the group should look at for the steering group to evaluate.

Please bring it up now. Inga, you've sent a long list of suggestions. Maybe you can bring forward a couple of those. Emilia from Helsinki has as well.

I strongly encourage you, given the time we have left, to send ideas with brief suggestions to me prior to December 1st. Then we will bring them up to the steering group.

### **Inga** (Baltic Circular Hotspot, Lithuania)

Yes, actually I sent you a very long list because I have quite a many questions. And I think that we need to make these ideas from each other in order to decide how we will go on.

**Main Idea:**

The main idea from my side is to use the Baltic Circular Hotspot and this collaboration which we are developing as a tool as well to connect our ecosystems.

I can see that even this example from Denmark is a very nice one. When the regulations, as I understand in your country, are oriented to the textile products which are put on the market in Denmark, they are much more higher than EU. That is why we need to foster the stakeholders to develop innovations.

I think this example could help us as well to connect more stakeholders in the Nordic-Baltic region - not only to maybe reach for higher limits, but as well to align to the EU regulations because companies in Lithuania as well, they are struggling quite a lot with those requirements.

I think that this ecosystem of companies and not only companies, but as well academia, and this collaboration could help us to develop a very good impact.

### **Emilia Jedda** (Finnish Textile and Fashion)

Thank you, and thank you for organizing this. I'm Emilia Jedda from Finnish Textile and Fashion. Due to that our CEO Maria-Liisa is on vacation at the moment, I'm here now.

We discussed this internally together with Maria-Liisa, and from our perspective or point of view, **the key priority should be to support and ensure that circularity and especially textile recycling become commercially and economically viable**, both in Europe as well as in our region.

This is heavily depending on the situation we have with:
- Extended Producer Responsibility coming into place
- ESPR (paragraph regarding destruction of unsold goods)

We find that it's really essential that we would have an infrastructure here in Europe or Nordics - we can decide the region closer together - and that we wouldn't be in a situation where we would be heavily depending on exporting all these textile materials outside of Europe, for example to China.

### **Frederik Thrane** (Closing)

Thank you, Emilia. I'm sorry to cut you off, but the session will close in 30 seconds.

**Final Requests:**

1. I strongly encourage you all to write us before December 1st, bullet point it with suggestions
2. We will collect them, bring them up with the steering group
3. Please spread the word - there haven't been as many people on this call as we could wish for
4. When we send out the link for the session, share it, invite relevant players in and ask them to join the mailing list through the link

Thank you so much. We're so excited to have you on board. We're so excited to see what this can become.

Have a good day and goodbye from Nuuk.
