# Locally Rooted, Globally Connected: Arctic Perspectives on Material Security and Circular Resilience

**Nordic Circular Summit 2025 - Session 3 Analysis**
**November 19, 2025 | Nuuk, Greenland**

---

## Executive Summary

In a session that brought together institutional leaders, financiers, and researchers against the backdrop of Greenland's rapidly changing Arctic landscape, Session 3 of the Nordic Circular Summit 2025 tackled one of the most pressing questions of our time: how do we build resilience in a world that relies on global value chains? The answer, as articulated by speakers from Sitra, the Nordic Investment Bank, Chatham House, and the European Economic and Social Committee, lies in a fundamental reframing of circular economy—not as an environmental nice-to-have, but as a strategic imperative for competitiveness and security.

The session, moderated by Alisa Mick (Miksi, Helsinki) and Keira Dignan (Regeneration 2030), revealed a structural shift in how the Nordics and Europe must approach material independence. With China's tightening grip on critical minerals, Europe's export of the very materials it needs most, and the scramble for battery metals threatening to create a race to the bottom on environmental and social standards, the circular economy has emerged as the only viable path to long-term resilience.

Crucially, the session introduced a vision that could reshape Arctic circular collaboration: the **ArcCirc** (Arctic Circular Economy Resource Centre), proposed by Cathrine Barth as an Arctic equivalent to the EU CERC, ensuring that 4 million Arctic residents are not left in a "linear lock-in" while the rest of the world transitions to circularity.

## Part 1: Setting the Scene - Climate Change and Critical Resources in the Arctic

### The Dual Reality

Alisa Mick opened the session by naming the paradox at the heart of the Arctic's relationship with the circular economy. "This session couldn't take place in a more fitting place than here in the Arctic region, and especially in Greenland, where the realities of climate change are unfolding faster than almost anywhere else on Earth," she said.

The Arctic is experiencing climate change at twice the global average rate. Sea ice is disappearing, permafrost is thawing, and local communities are watching their ways of life transform before their eyes. At the same time, the Arctic is home to critical resources—rare earth metals, graphite, cobalt, and other minerals—that are essential for the very technologies needed to combat climate change: batteries, wind turbines, solar panels, and electric vehicles.

This dual reality creates both vulnerability and opportunity. The Arctic is simultaneously a victim of the linear, extractive economy and a potential cornerstone of the circular transition. How can economic ambitions be matched with coordinated approaches to climate security and long-term resilience? How can the circular economy serve local self-sufficiency while maintaining vital connections to Europe and the world?

These questions framed the entire session, and the answers would prove to be both challenging and inspiring.

## Part 2: The Critical Materials Challenge - A Strategic Blind Spot

### Mika Sulkinoja's Keynote: Resilience in Global Value Chains

Joining remotely from a "sort of snowy Helsinki," Mika Sulkinoja, World Circular Economy Coordinator at Sitra, delivered a comprehensive keynote that laid bare Europe's critical materials vulnerability.

"Few issues illustrate this better than the accelerating race for critical energy transition minerals," Sulkinoja began. "Demand for these transition minerals is growing rapidly and market signals point to tightening supply in the years ahead."

The statistics are sobering:
- Export restrictions are increasing, especially for rare earth metals, cobalt, lithium, and graphite
- China's export controls on graphite in 2024 showed how quickly supply chains can tighten
- Europe lacks dedicated trade codes to track recycled or secondary material flows—a "strategic blind spot"

### The EU's Ambitious Targets—and the Paradox

The EU Critical Raw Materials Act sets ambitious 2030 targets:
- **10% extraction** within the EU
- **40% processing** within the EU
- **25% recycling** within the EU

"But here is the paradox," Sulkinoja noted. "Europe continues to export the materials it needs most." Black mass—the metal-rich fraction from crushed lithium-ion batteries containing lithium, cobalt, nickel, and manganese—is exported rather than recycled domestically, undermining Europe's recycling targets and deepening external dependency.

This led to the session's first major reframing: **"Circularity is therefore clearly no longer an environmental agenda. It is now a matter of competitiveness and security for Europe and for all other regions as well."**

The circular economy has transformed from a sustainability nice-to-have into a geopolitical necessity.

---

## Part 3: Mining + Circularity - The Both/And Solution

### "We Cannot Mine Our Way Out of This Dependency"

Sulkinoja delivered one of the session's most quotable lines: "One thing is clear, **we cannot mine our way out of this dependency**."

But he immediately added nuance. "At the same time, we will still need mining in the years ahead. Mining remains essential for meeting near-term demand for batteries, renewables, infrastructure and clean technologies."

The real question, he argued, is not whether to mine or to circularize, but **how to combine responsible mining with circularity, substitution and much longer product lifetimes**.

"If we rely on mining alone, we stay vulnerable. And if we rely on circularity alone, we cannot scale fast enough. We need both. But circularity must define the long-term path."

This both/and framing was crucial. Too often, the debate is polarized: mining advocates versus circular economy proponents, growth versus degrowth, technology versus behavior change. Sulkinoja's message was more sophisticated: we need all of the above, but with circularity setting the strategic direction.

The Nordic region, he noted, possesses promising innovations: sodium ion technologies, bio-based anodes, new methods of recovering metals from tailings. "But innovation needs supportive rules," he emphasized, pointing to the forthcoming Circular Economy Act under the EU's Clean Industrial Deal.

---

## Part 4: Inner Loops - The Real Economic Prize

### Beyond Recycling: Reuse, Repair, Refurbishment

Sulkinoja then challenged what may be the most common misconception about circular economy: that recycling is the goal.

"Recycling is essential, but it is really the last loop of circularity," he explained. "**The strongest economic and social benefits come from the inner loops: reuse, repair, refurbishment and re-manufacturing.**"

This hierarchy matters economically. According to the European Commission's Competitiveness Compass, **Europe's remanufacturing market could grow from 31 billion euros today to around 100 billion euros by 2030—creating up to half a million jobs**. The value retention and job creation from keeping products in use far exceeds that of recycling materials.

### ESPR: Europe's Most Important Upstream Measure

Underpinning the inner loops is the **Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation (ESPR)**, which Sulkinoja described as "one of the most important upstream measures Europe has ever introduced."

ESPR sets horizontal requirements for:
- Durability
- Repairability
- Upgradability
- Recyclability
- Digital Product Passports across a wide range of product groups

The Digital Product Passport will make visible what Cathrine Barth would later call "material journeys"—the reality that "every material comes from somewhere and is going to live possibly forever." This visibility is foundational to material economics, material rights, and material ownership—concepts that are just now entering mainstream policy discourse.

"The Act combined with ESPR must go beyond a narrow focus on material efficiency," Sulkinoja urged. "To truly unlock potential of these inner loops, it needs to address remanufacturing, refurbishment, reuse markets and other measures that extend product lifetimes. Without this broader scope, Europe risks missing the largest circularity gains."

**The policy implication is clear: longer product lifetimes mean stronger resilience.**

---

## Part 5: Global Collaboration - EU CERC and the India Forum

### No Country Can Build Circularity Alone

"Material flows cross borders, ecosystems and political systems," Sulkinoja observed. "They pass through biodiversity hotspots, indigenous territories and economies where informal workers are essential. Because these value chains are so interconnected, no country or region can build circularity alone."

This interconnection is why the **EU Circular Economy Resource Centre (EU CERC)** was established in 2025 by the European Commission and the Finnish Ministry for Foreign Affairs, implemented by Sitra and Belgium's Enabel.

EU CERC operates on three fronts:
1. **Policy lab** - circular roadmaps and governance
2. **Business lab** - SMEs and investment ecosystems
3. **Knowledge lab** - peer learning and expertise sharing

A key priority is strengthening critical material partnerships between the EU and partner countries, supporting circular investment, technological cooperation, and secure sustainable supply.

### The Shift to India: Upstream Solutions at Last

After hosting the World Circular Economy Forum in Brazil in 2024, Sitra is now focusing on India for the next forum. "Discussions with our Indian partners point clearly toward a shift from narrow focus on recycling to a broader embrace of upstream solutions," Sulkinoja noted.

Emerging themes for the India forum include:
- Circular business models in major manufacturing clusters (textiles, ICT, automotive)
- AI and data infrastructure for circularity
- Resource security in critical minerals
- **Integrating informal workers into fair and circular value chains**

This last point is crucial. In India and across the Global South, informal waste pickers, recyclers, and repairers form the backbone of existing circular systems. Any transition must ensure these workers benefit rather than being displaced.

"This aligns closely with Europe's biggest gap today: the inner loops of circularity," Sulkinoja concluded. "Next forum will be a pivotal moment for shaping global progress on upstream circular solutions."

## Part 6: The Panel Discussion - Balancing Ambitions, Finance, and Rights

### Anders Ladefoged: The Political Question

When asked how the EU can balance competing goals—55% emissions cuts by 2030, climate neutrality by 2050, critical materials targets, and competitiveness—Anders Ladefoged of the European Economic and Social Committee gave a refreshingly honest answer: **"That is really a very political question, and I think you will get different answers depending on who you ask."**

Many European countries and industrial sectors view the Commission's initiatives as cost drivers that hurt competitiveness. "So in a way, we need to, from a Nordic perspective, to think how we deal with this," Ladefoged said.

His answer was to flip the question. Rather than asking whether the goals are achievable, ask whether they're aligned with Nordic values and Nordic company ambitions. "All these initiatives are very good. It's good ambitions. And they've aligned well with the level of ambitions that we have in the Nordic countries."

The problem, he argued, is that the Nordics are "a bit shy." "We sometimes look too much at getting things right at home," he observed. "I think that we also, at a political level, should engage more with the other Europeans and try to convince them that the things that the commission has proposed are really good and ambitious."

### The Stakeholder Platform: Connecting the Dots

Ladefoged encouraged Nordic stakeholders to engage with the **European Circular Economy Stakeholder Platform**, which has been operating since 2017. "It does exactly what we have already discussed many times today: connect the dots, connect the actors, learn from each other."

His message was strategic: **"If we only stay in the corner, we will not scale the whole thing."**

The Nordics cannot achieve 25% circularity alone. They need to share their successes, learn from others, and help persuade skeptical European regions that the transition is both necessary and beneficial.

## Part 7: From "Why" to "How" - The Investment Gap

### Companies Are On Board—But the Gap Is Huge

In a follow-up question, Alisa Mick asked about the shift from companies asking "why circular?" to "how do we implement?" Ladefoged confirmed this shift is real, but emphasized the challenge that remains.

"We actually did an analysis together with Boston Consulting Group on what will it take for Europe to become more sustainable in transport, energy, circularity," he explained. "You realize that there are not only regulatory deficiencies, but also **an investment gap that is huge**."

The resulting 40-page document called for:
- **Off-take guarantees**
- **Floor prices**
- **More public procurement**
- **Binding requirements for recycled content**

"Things that are actually quite far-reaching," Ladefoged noted. "But that's what it will take to do it in practice."

The fact that Danish industry companies endorsed this call is significant. "When a company is starting to call for things like this, it means that **they are on board**," Ladefoged concluded.

This is the shift: companies are no longer resisting regulation; they're calling for stronger, more predictable policy frameworks that create investable markets.

## Part 8: The Banking Perspective - Value Creation and Resilience

### Luca De Lorenzo: "Money Goes Where Value Is Created"

Luca De Lorenzo of the Nordic Investment Bank brought what he called "realistic banking boredom" to the discussion, but his insights were anything but boring. They revealed a fundamental shift in how finance views circular economy.

"I think it was very nice this morning. You started with value creation, right?" De Lorenzo said. "And that is fundamental from a financier's perspective. **Money goes where value is created. It's as simple as that.**"

For years, circular economy proponents have struggled to make the business case for circularity when linear models appear cheaper. De Lorenzo's answer: the business case is changing because the value of resilience has increased.

### The Structural Shift: Resilience Over Cost

"Compared to 10, 15 years ago, if we were running a big corporation, what you would do you would optimize your supply chain purely on cost. The cheapest is the best," De Lorenzo explained. "Now the trust and the dependencies that we have are critical. They don't work always. And that has a value."

**"It means that shortening supply chains has a value. And we can put a dollar or a euro sign or a kroner sign to it."**

This is not a temporary COVID-19 or Ukraine-war effect. "This is structural. It's not going to go away even if we get a bit more peace," De Lorenzo emphasized. "The fundamental trust in the market is broken."

This structural shift fundamentally changes the investment case for circular business models. Local recycling, remanufacturing, and repair networks that seemed uneconomical when optimizing purely for cost now make financial sense when the value of supply chain resilience is factored in.

"These businesses, these type of solutions, suddenly become much more interesting to finance," De Lorenzo concluded.

### Concrete Examples: FERC and Green Steel

De Lorenzo shared examples from the Nordic Investment Bank's portfolio:
- **FERC in Denmark**: Plastic recycling for food-containing materials, with product design integration
- **Green steel in Sweden and Finland**: OtoKumpu recycling up to 70% scrap using electric arc furnaces

"Again, circularity of these metals makes value sense in our economies," he said. "My main message is **the importance and the value of resilience and autonomy increases the business case for circular models**."

## Part 9: Long-term Partnerships Over Short-term Politics

### Patrick Schroeder: Policy-Driven Transformation

Patrick Schroeder of Chatham House brought an international policy perspective, noting that "the circular economy from our analysis is definitely a **policy-driven transformation**."

The policies, targets, and long-term signals from the EU are essential for investment certainty. Schroeder's work with UNIDO has documented **75+ national circular economy roadmaps globally**, with more being added each year. "So it's an ongoing policy trend that we see internationally."

But partnerships need to go deeper than typical trade deals. "To build in circularity into these value chains requires more than normal commitment, more than normal trade deals," Schroeder argued. "That's where the long-term vision is needed."

### The Risk: Short-term Politics Disrupting Long-term Plans

Schroeder also highlighted the risk that "these are disrupted by more short-term focused policies, politics." When political winds shift—as they did with the 2024 U.S. election—decades-long investments can be threatened.

He urged that "border issues around stability of climate systems, ecosystems, all that needs still to be considered when we talk about competitiveness, when we talk about resilience. So it's a much more holistic picture that needs to be included into policymaking."

The circular economy cannot be separated from climate stability, biodiversity protection, and social justice. These must be integrated into competitiveness discussions, not treated as externalities.

## Part 10: Arctic Perspectives - Bureaucracy and Autonomy

### The Complexity Problem

When asked about the Arctic perspective, Anders Ladefoged delivered perhaps the session's most uncomfortable truth for EU policymakers.

In preparing the European Economic and Social Committee's Arctic policy report, stakeholders across the Arctic said one thing consistently: **"For small entities in the Arctic with limited resources, a lot of the programs and other things that EU provides, as good as they are well intentioned, are extremely complicated."**

**"It's complicated to apply, it's complicated to report,"** Ladefoged explained. There was a "general wish, almost a sigh" for programs to be "a little more simply, simple, a little more unbureaucratic, a little more adapted to an Arctic context."

This is the tension between locally rooted and globally connected. Brussels-designed frameworks, however well-intentioned, may not fit Arctic realities. Small communities with limited administrative capacity cannot navigate the same application and reporting processes as large European corporations or municipalities.

"That is really important if you want to make the locally rooted perspective fit with what comes from so far away as Brussels, both in terms of policy and in terms of tools," Ladefoged concluded.

## Part 11: Indigenous Rights and Free Prior Informed Consent

### 80% of Biodiversity in Indigenous Lands

Keira Dignan brought the discussion to what may be its most critical and sensitive topic: indigenous rights in the context of critical minerals extraction.

"We know that in our region a lot of the critical minerals are located in indigenous lands, either in the north of Sweden, Finland, Norway, in Sápmi, also in Greenland," Dignan noted. "We know that there are excellent frameworks available, for example, the UN's **free prior informed consent (FPIC)**."

But the track record is poor. "Over the last 20, 30 years, we have across the board seen **inadequate application of free prior informed consent** from indigenous communities for mining."

The stakes are high: **"80% of the world's biodiversity is located in lands that are stewarded by indigenous peoples."** Getting this right is essential not just for justice, but for planetary health.

### Value Redistribution and Accountability

Luca De Lorenzo responded with two principles: **value redistribution** and **accountability**.

"If you do transition, if you do go there, there should be a value creation. What is important is redistribution of that value creation," he said. "We need to have a way so that that value creation doesn't only go to the project or to the corporate that goes there, but **there is a good mechanism to redistribute that value**."

This is a core Nordic value—inclusiveness and well-functioning societies—that must be applied globally. "It's only through inclusiveness and well-functioning societies that you can actually get the change in the longer term perspective."

But De Lorenzo also introduced a more controversial point about mutual accountability. While those instigating change must ensure everyone is heard and that change isn't "shoved down the throat," communities also "have to understand a little bit the bigger picture, make sure that they get a chunk of the value creation and they're part of it. But they also have to understand the need for the change and somehow embrace it."

### Race to the Bottom Risk

Patrick Schroeder agreed that indigenous voices "have been neglected for many, many years," sharing the example of UNEP's Global Environment Outlook bringing indigenous representatives into scientific assessments, where their traditional knowledge "changed many of the discussions."

But he raised the geopolitical risk: "There's the danger that **the scramble for critical minerals leads to a race to the bottom**."

US companies under the Trump administration, Chinese mining companies, and increasingly Middle Eastern investors "do not look at ESG or indigenous rights." This creates pressure on European companies.

"The big question for European companies is **can we still maintain this prior informed consent? Are we able to pay maybe a higher price?**" Schroeder asked. Then he answered his own rhetorical question: **"We have to."**

"We need to do this despite the international pressure that we might have," he affirmed.

### Dialogue as Opportunity, Not Obligation

Anders Ladefoged closed this discussion by reframing indigenous consultation: **"This dialogue is not just something that should be seen as an obligation, it should also be seen as an opportunity."**

"The decisions that are made and the solutions that are implemented will be better if they involve input from the people who actually live and work in the Arctic," he said. "There are **around four million globally living and working in the Arctic**. Some of them are indigenous, some are not."

"If you talk to these people, they all have their vision of how their local environment could be improved, how you could get attractive jobs, study what you want, get the facilities that you need to want to stay there and live there."

The key is not coming with "ready-made solutions top-down" but engaging in genuine dialogue about what works, what doesn't, and what's missing.

## Part 12: The ArcCirc Vision - Arctic Solidarity

### Cathrine Barth's Closing Reflections

Cathrine Barth closed the session with reflections that synthesized the institutional, financial, and rights-based perspectives—and introduced a bold proposal.

"It has been quite remarkable listening for institutional approaches. Very strong, very committed from Sitra and the Nordic Investment Bank," she began. "But also listening how much emphasis is going now on the global south. So that leaves us **what is the Arctic point of view**?"

"How do we secure that **we're not left in a linear lock-in and being out on the limbs**?" she asked.

### The Arctic as a Nation

Barth reframed the Arctic in powerful terms: **"The Arctic community is actually quite a large nation, if you put in that terms, with 4 million people."**

Viewed this way, the Arctic is not a marginal region but a significant entity deserving of coordinated circular economy support.

She highlighted the shift in material awareness: "We haven't been so aware of where materials come from, how we keep them in the economy." The Digital Product Passport will make visible that "every material, whatever, even if they have a history, they come from somewhere and **they are going to live possibly forever**."

This is a profound shift—from materials as throughput to materials as permanent actors in the economy. Material economics, material independency, material rights, material ownership—these concepts are "newborn topics," Barth noted. "We have to be a little bit clumsy, a little bit large and forgiving. And we have to really embrace these topics because **they connect us**."

### The ArcCirc Proposal

Then came the vision: inspired by Sitra's solidarity in establishing EU CERC to engage with the Global South, Barth asked: **"How could it be if we go together and establish an ArcCirc?"**

**ArcCirc—an Arctic Circular Economy Resource Centre—modeled on EU CERC but focused on Arctic solidarity and collaboration.**

"What is maybe the Arctic solidarity or Arctic collaboration approach?" Barth wondered. This is one of many dialogues over the two-day summit, she noted, with further discussions on material agency and collaboration to come.

The ArcCirc vision offers a concrete institutional mechanism to ensure that 4 million Arctic residents are active participants in—not passive recipients of—the circular transition. It would provide:
- Policy support adapted to Arctic contexts
- Business development for Arctic circular enterprises
- Knowledge sharing among Arctic communities
- Voice and agency for indigenous and local populations

## Part 13: Synthesis and Implications

### From Environmental Agenda to Strategic Imperative

Session 3 marked a decisive shift in how circular economy is framed. No longer primarily about waste reduction or environmental protection, **circularity is now understood as a competitiveness and security strategy**.

Europe's dependency on China for critical materials, the tightening of supply chains, and the export of needed materials while recycling targets go unmet—these are strategic vulnerabilities that only circularity can address in the long term.

### Inner Loops as Economic Priority

The emphasis on **inner loops over recycling** represents a maturation of circular thinking. The economic and job creation potential of remanufacturing (31 to 100 billion euros, 500,000 jobs) dwarfs that of recycling alone. Policy frameworks like ESPR that mandate durability, repairability, and digital product passports are the foundation for this shift.

### The Structural Shift in Finance

Luca De Lorenzo's insight about the **structural shift in value of resilience** may be the session's most significant economic takeaway. When supply chain resilience becomes monetizable, circular business models that previously seemed uneconomical suddenly become attractive investments. This shift is permanent, not cyclical.

### Policy-Driven but Partnership-Dependent

Patrick Schroeder's point about circular economy as **policy-driven transformation** was balanced by recognition that partnerships must go deeper than normal trade deals. The 75+ national roadmaps globally show policy momentum, but long-term, stable frameworks are needed to give investors certainty.

### The Both/And of Mining and Circularity

Mika Sulkinoja's formulation—**we need both mining and circularity, but circularity must define the long-term path**—provides a pragmatic framework for navigating transition tensions. This rejects false binaries in favor of sequenced priorities.

### Indigenous Rights as Non-Negotiable

The discussion of FPIC and indigenous rights established that **Europe must maintain high standards despite competitive pressure**. The "race to the bottom" risk is real, but the response is to double down on value redistribution, accountability, and genuine dialogue—viewing indigenous consultation as opportunity, not obligation.

### Arctic as Actor, Not Object

Cathrine Barth's reframing of the Arctic as a "4 million person nation" and the **ArcCirc proposal** position the Arctic as an active agent in circular transition. This is essential: the Arctic cannot be merely a source of extraction or a victim of climate change, but must be a partner in designing circular futures.

### Material Economics as New Reality

The session introduced **material economics**—material journeys, material rights, material ownership—as emerging concepts that will reshape economic thinking. The Digital Product Passport makes visible what has been invisible: the permanent presence and movement of materials through economic systems.

---

## Conclusion: Locally Rooted and Globally Connected

The session's title, "Locally Rooted: Materialising a Circular Future," captured the dual imperative facing the Arctic and the Nordics.

**Locally rooted** means:
- Self-sufficiency through longer product lifetimes, repair, and reuse
- Regional production networks that keep value local
- Adaptation of global frameworks to Arctic contexts
- Indigenous rights and local knowledge at the center

**Globally connected** means:
- Transparent value chains that cross borders responsibly
- Fair partnerships that share benefits equitably
- Policies that align local needs with European and international transitions
- Collaboration through platforms like EU CERC and, potentially, ArcCirc

The Nordics have a strong foundation: a tradition of trust, experience with local-global cooperation, and industries that increasingly view full value chains rather than individual segments.

But as Mika Sulkinoja concluded: "Not to create perfect self-sufficiency, but **systems that are more resilient, more regenerative and more aligned with the places where we live and work**."

In the end, the session revealed that the circular economy is not about closing loops for their own sake. It's about building resilience, creating secure and fair material flows, respecting indigenous rights, maintaining competitiveness, and ensuring that places like the Arctic—where climate change hits hardest and critical resources are most abundant—are active partners in shaping our collective future.

The question is no longer whether we can afford to transition to circular economy. The question, as the session made clear, is whether we can afford not to.
