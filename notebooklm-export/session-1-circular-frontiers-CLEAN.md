### **Einar Kleppe Holthe** (Main Host/Moderator)
Perfect. And the sound is working. Thank you so much. Thank you so much for a wonderful ceremony. And now formally we can introduce and say welcome to the Nordic Circular Summit 2025 here in Nuuk. It's with great joy. We are a great team of collaborators and partners who've done this. So on behalf of the organizers, I want to say a deep welcome. And we are going to have two fantastic days. Eva, do you want to say a few words from your side?

### **Eva Jørgensen** (Greenland Business Association)
Yeah. Well, that said, I'm— Maybe. Eva from the Greenland Business Association. We are the local partners for this event and we are very happy to have this opportunity to contribute to the collaboration in the circular transition.

### **Einar Kleppe Holthe**
And I also want to, on behalf of Nordic Circular Hotspot in the Nordics and the Arctic and also Natural State in Norway, I want to say a great welcome. I also have with me the Nordic Circular Hotspot managing partners, represented with Fredrik from Lifestyle and Design Cluster, Michel from CradleNet, and Cathrine from also Natural State in Norway. We are very delighted to have been organizing this together. It's been very important to have a good partnership in conducting this conference. And Edward, do you want to say a little bit about who you are?

### **Edvard Lybert Mørk** (Nalek Ventures, Greenland)
Welcome to all the outsiders from Nuuk to Greenland. Nuuk, it's a bit gloomy, but still we hope that you will enjoy the stay in Nuuk during your days here, so we're very excited to be a part of this Nordic Circular Summit. So I hope we get some very good days. Yes. And to do the formal opening...

### **Einar Kleppe Holthe**
We would be honored to welcome Peter Borg from the Government of Greenland, Ministry of Fisheries, Hunting, Agriculture and Self-Sufficiency to the stage to do the formal opening. Thank you.

*(Applause)*

## PART 2.5: Formal Opening by Minister
**Time**: ~09:25 - 09:30 (5 minutes)

### **Peter Borg** (Naalakkersuisoq/Minister, Government of Greenland)
*(Speaks in Greenlandic)*

It is always a very emotional moment for me, the lighting of the lamp and the drum song. It awakens my spiritual partner inside me, my companion, the polar bear. So it was emotional.

Distinguished guests, partners and participants from our Greenlandic communities, it is a pleasure to welcome you to Greenland and the Nordic Circular Summit 2025. On behalf of the Government of Greenland, I thank you for being here. For visitors arriving from afar, welcome. For participants from our Greenlandic communities, thank you for joining this summit.

This year's summit marks the first time that the event is held in one of the self-governing territories of the Nordic constellation. This is an important milestone, as it reflects a willingness to engage more directly with the diverse political and geographical realities that defines the broader context in which this summit operates.

This gathering brings together perspectives from different regions, professions, and traditions. It allows us to share Greenlandic experiences while learning from the knowledge represented here, and to explore approaches that can strengthen sustainable food systems and local value creation.

Our participation is guided by Greenland's self-sufficiency strategy, which shapes the long-term development in our country. The strategy aims to reduce import dependency, strengthen local value creation, and ensure that development is anchored in Greenlandic culture. These priorities guide how we manage fisheries, hunting, and agriculture. Supporting stable and resilient communities, they remind us that growth is most effective when it's built on local strength and knowledge.

Greenlandic tradition in hunting and local food production are built on generations of practical experience. They reflect careful use of resources where nothing is wasted and every part of the catch has a purpose. This cultural foundation continues to inform how we develop food systems today, connecting tradition with modern opportunities for innovation.

The Arctic perspective brings additional insight to these discussions. Greenland's geographic and climatic conditions create unique challenges and opportunities. Remote communities, seasonal variation, and local knowledge encourage approaches that are adaptive, practical, and community-driven. These conditions have fostered innovation in sustainable food systems, ocean-based industries, and locally-led initiatives. Local communities are central to these efforts, providing knowledge, participation, and framework that enable new solutions to emerge.

The summit provides a setting where these different viewpoints can meet. When experience from various regions and sectors are shared openly, they broaden our understanding and help us see new possibilities. Many of the organizations represented here have developed valuable methods for strengthening local value chains and supporting responsible development. Through shared dialogue, we gain insight into how solutions emerge in different contexts.

We are confident that the sessions ahead will be productive and engaging. They will provide space for thoughtful exchange for ideas to take shape in ways that respect local conditions while offering inspiration beyond our borders. Thank you for being here and for sharing your perspectives.

*(Speaks in Greenlandic)*

*(Applause)*

## PART 3: Arctic & Greenlandic Perspectives
**Time**: 09:30 - 09:40 (10 minutes)

### **Einar Kleppe Holthe**
Thank you, Peter Borg, so much for sharing your perspective with all of us. It is really about what you spoke of now that we want to gather people to talk together about new solutions and new systems and also how we transition these old systems that we need to develop from. This is the core essence of Nordic Circular Hotspot and also the reason for having the summits. And also why we've chosen a circular frontier here in the Arctic and try to learn and talk about how we can shape our future. Because that is what we're talking about when we talk about circular and sustainable solutions.

I've been challenged to give a little bit of insight in the Nordic Circular Summit. So I made the Nordic Circular Hotspot perspectives and how we work and what we do. Why do we do this? And how have we done it? And what have we done? And what kind of approaches do we have?

Nordic Circular Hotspot is about accelerating the transition to a circular and sustainable economy in the Nordics, in all of the Nordics, but also in the touch outside of the Nordics through our value chains. It's about collaboration. It's also now about implementation, how we can actually get things done. We've been talking and thinking and strategizing for a few years, but now we need to do. And it's about value creation. Value creation is the core essence. It needs to be valuable, and we need to make every value count. And that is what we need to talk about a little bit, because we are working with a market development process. It is about value in the Nordic market, the value chains of the market, and how they work together. And we are an organization for acceleration of circular value creation in the value chains of the Nordic market sphere and beyond. So it's all about the value chains and how we transition the value chains of our societies and markets with circular principles, circular approaches.

Very quickly, value. Value is the core essence of us. It's the value of our life. It's a nature value that we belong to, and it's really the balance between human and nature values that is now in imbalance of the old systems. And we need to reflect on this. And the society and market are the systems of value transfer. Either it's from fishery to food, if it's from hunting to garment, and how you work with all the natural resources to sustain our lives in our local communities.

It is about culture and context. The culture value that you just shown and explained is phenomenally important. And the context of where you are, the context of place, and the local-global connection. How do you create strong, resilient local societies with circular value chains that is interacting with the global market that we have and is completely without any regulatory mechanisms in taking care of natural value? So we need to make it in the local regional aspects.

It's about the understanding of rural and urban. How do you work in a rural environment? And how do you work in an urban environment? And how are they connected through the value chains of others? And physical-digital— how to choose quantity or quality? What is qualities of life? And do you need everything that you want?

And moving from linear to circular— it is the essence that we have to ask ourselves. Is this value proposition based on circular and sustainable principles, or is it not? And that is where we need to take everything. And we need to move from short-term view to long-term view to understand the effect of our action in a long-term perspective. That is essential. We need to move from meaningless growth to sustainable development of values and qualities of life, societies, and communities. And we need to understand our old time and create a new time, our future, based on these deep understandings of the core essence— nature, human, society, and market— mixed together.

It's all systems, but it's also value principles that we need to maintain. And it is in the society and market we balance human and nature again. And that is the full circle of how we see and perceive the value chains. And value is everything we can be. It can be the environmental value, circular value, or contextual value of nature. It can be the innovation value, collaboration value, or cultural value of a society. It can be the identity value, the relations value, the sense of belonging to a place, and the emotional value that drives us, the trust that creates collaborations. And in the market, it is form. Can it be a transparent market? Is it the value chains? Is it the web shop? Or is it a fish market? It's the locality. Is it local or global? How does it affect it? And what is the functions of it? Is it sustainable, regenerative value creation, circular? Or is it not? Is it non-sustainable? And this is the things we need to understand. So that is value.

And then economy, because circular is a value, and economy is the other. And we are relating to the new economic languages that is now informing how we speak of nature again in the economic systems. I'm an economist. We work with describing nature value, human value, societal value in the market. And the economy is the language of the market. And now there is new economic languages forming. Circular economy is one of the key essences that we work with. I find local economy one of the most important. How can you localize? How can you work with transparency trade? How can you work with SDG economies, regenerative economies, or cultural economy as an essence? This is the languages we need to speak of.

And in that Nordic Circular Hotspot, we're working with circular economy because circular economy is the best description of natural resource in societal and market systems for sustaining human life. Circular Economy goes on kilos, not krona or dollars. It really explains the natural resources in our systems. And that is why this is now coming. This is from HIVE Economy Initiative in 2019, where they said, what is the future most important value for the world economics to come? It is the nature value, because it also becomes a scarcity. This is why Circular Economy is so important.

And we work strategically and systemically and with a place-based approach to how to understand the Nordic market sphere— the value chains, the sectors that enable the value chains, and the contextual factors of the local societies and the Nordic Arctic region. And we decipher everything from food and beverage to innovation R&D and the local or the regional governance methods that creates the frame of value creation.

And in this sphere, this is what we've been doing the last five years. And now we've been starting to find transition groups that can go in and transition value chains with circular principles. They can transition financing, can transition construction. We've been doing insights in how the finance mechanisms for circular and sustainable solutions work, and also the regulatory framework of how we can make it happen and what needs to change. And now it's about implementation, taking it out into the market. Because it has to be business viable. It has to create economic value. If not, it will not sustain itself.

And now we're looking into how you can implement circular solutions into the construction sector, how you can do transformative approach to buildings and fill it with new meaning and function. And this is what we do.

The other thing we do is to gather the people. So this is the sixth summit. We started in Oslo in 2020, Copenhagen in 2021, Stockholm 2022, Reykjavik in '23, and Helsinki last year. And there was a meaning that we decided to go for the autonomous regions the next three years. Here in Nuuk, Tórshavn, Faroe Islands... We wanted to create the same dialogue exactly on the principles that you spoke of, Peter Borg. It was a fantastic summary of how we want to bring important topics into conversations of those who do things. And this is what we do.

And we want to look at the Nordic structure as a scalable market where we can take local solutions into 28 million people, five countries, three autonomous regions, and actually help them create viable business solutions with circular and sustainable principles and share the knowledge of how you do this, create these resilient local communities in this regional structure. It is about scaling now, scaling the solutions. It's been a lot of innovation, it's been a lot of entrepreneurial factors, but to make it viable, we need to scale and make enterprises out of the circular solutions and use it as a benefit in the global competition with the values that we stand for collectively and also locally. That is the core.

It's all about the value chains of the Nordics and how we understand it together with, of course, the Arctic sphere. And that is where we are. And it's about the people. And that is why we're here, in good partnerships and collaboration. And you're, of course, all welcome to join. This is a partner-driven organization and initiative. And this is also where we meet and talk, because in the end, it's all up to us. We are the one taking the decision on how we want to create a future value.

So on that note, that was a very quick, brief introduction to what we do with Nordic Circular Hotspot and why we are here, and what we want to talk about, and how we can see how this works. And on that note, I want to invite our local partners, our new partners, Eva and Gorm, to the stage to talk a little bit about why you decided to join and be our partners here in Nuuk and Greenland for this work. Thank you.

And of course, this is a broadcast from Nuuk to all over the world. It's a hybrid digital and physical conference. We're waiting for Gorm, which is currently in Brussels, is he not? Showing the relevance of also thinking global in how we work with local resilience. I can see him. He's on his way. *(Sighs)* There you are. Hi, hi. Welcome to stage. Thank you.

### **Eva Jørgensen**
Thank you. And as you say, the circular transition is very local, and we all need to learn and get inspired by each other. And that's why we are happy to be here, to be able to communicate some of the initiatives from around the Nordics to the rest of Greenland, hopefully. And Gorm, you are in Greenland days?

### **Gorm Vold** (Joining remotely from Brussels)
I am here in Brussels, arranged by the EU Commission and the Government of Greenland. And we have, well, the circularity in general, Nordic circularity as well, the Arctic circularity, the knowledge and the culture behind our view of our contribution to this theme— this topic— is widely local, as mentioned, but also international now where Greenland is in a transition, very focused on many situations where we can contribute to this topic.

So here in Greenland— in Brussels— we have a lot of discussions as well with the European Commission and the EU in general with our contribution to circularity. It's not a circularity conference meetings, but it's very much agenda-based on the view— global connection, a Nordic connection as well. So it's very interesting to be a part of that too.

### **Einar Kleppe Holthe**
Very good. And what are the talks in Brussels?

### **Gorm Vold**
Oh, they began this morning. Very interesting talks. Now they have the plan through the week to talk about the hydropower, how to produce those energy forms. There are talks about digital transition, if I may say so, and other topics related to that. Other topics are of course, the raw material and minerals that EU want to be a part of in a Greenlandic perspective. And I know that there will be other talks that are maybe bilateral talks between EU and the Government of Greenland.

So very interesting topics and very important talks because they actually are focusing on the environmental perspective. They are talking about the connection between Greenland and EU and of course other topics as well. There are a lot of Greenlandic participants here— from Greenland here in Brussels— so there are ministers, there are officials, there are companies from Greenland that like Nalek has taken the long way to Brussels.

### **Einar Kleppe Holthe**
Thank you so much. It's very good to get the insight. And of course, it was a shame that you're not here with us, but you're doing important conversations in Brussels. And on that note, I think we should continue with the conversations here. It was a pleasure seeing you, Gorm, and we will see you again and talk through the days to try to bring some of the impressions into the working groups and the working time we will have tomorrow during the workshops.

### **Gorm Vold**
Yes, thank you for having a small view of the conference. I had to admit that I was very eager to participate myself, but you cannot be two places at the same time. I hope you will get very much out of the day today and of course tomorrow at Nalek Ventures' place. So we'll come again from Nalek as well. Thank you so much.

### **Einar Kleppe Holthe**
Thank you, Eva.

## PART 4: Introduction by Nordic Innovation
**Time**: 09:40 - 09:43 (3 minutes)

### **Einar Kleppe Holthe**
Then this Nordic Circular Hotspot and Nordic Circular Summit would not happen without our most kind— our strongest partner over time— Nordic Innovation. They've always been a partner in working together in this agenda, working to facilitate business innovations with sustainable angles. Marthe and Peter, would you like to come to the stage and join me here to give some brief reflections from your perspective. Hi, welcome.

### **Marthe Haugland** (Nordic Innovation)
Hello, thank you.

### **Einar Kleppe Holthe**
Please, we have the speaker here, the microphone. Thank you.

### **Peter Munch Madsen** (Nordic Innovation)
What a pleasure to meet you all. It's a great honor to be in Greenland. It's a great honor to meet the Minister also, and to meet all of you. I am Peter from Nordic Innovation, and as you see, Nordic Innovation offers Nordic solutions to global challenges. That's only a part of us. We are also a part of the Nordic Council of Ministers, which is the collaboration between the five Nordic countries and the Arctic region. So we are born to enable the vision of the Nordic Council of Ministers to create the most integrated and sustainable region in the world.

And we are doing that by enhancing collaboration for business and different actors across the Nordic region. And we are 15 people in Oslo. And we have three programs: innovative solutions, working on green transition. And we have a program on deep technology, critical technologies, and then on capital attraction, and also internationalization. And that's just a brief intro to the organization. And Marthe, you will tell a bit more about that.

### **Marthe Haugland**
Yes, if we could just change the slide... Because Nordic Innovation, we gather— we try to gather actors around projects, collaboration projects that will benefit all the actors involved. And this call for proposals is open now. It is about innovative solutions, but we're looking for solutions, networks, that can be in the market or be ready by 2030. Should be green solutions.

And then we also have— we're looking also ahead, what do we need after 2050? Perhaps we need new partnerships, new areas of work together, and new areas, ways of working, so that we can actually manage and be prepared for the 2050s, with new solutions for that as well.

And just to mention, you need to be partners from three Nordic countries, at least. And there is a total of 30 million NOK, which is not a huge amount of money, but which can go a long way when it facilitates Nordic solutions and Nordic collaborations. So you can have a look. It's 11th of February. And please do not hesitate to contact us during the two days and, of course, online if you have any questions.

And now, I think we are ready to discuss a little bit on the Nordic Arctic panel.

## PART 5: Nordic Arctic Panel – Circular Innovation Across Borders
**Time**: 09:43 - 10:10 (27 minutes)

### **Marthe Haugland** (Moderator)
And I would like to introduce and to welcome to stage our panelists on this Nordic panel, talking about Nordic collaboration.

**Panelists:**
- Cathrine Barth from Nordic Circular Hotspot, Natural State from Norway
- Michel Bajuk from Sweden and CradleNet, and also Nordic Circular Hotspot
- Edvard Lybert Mørk from Nalek Ventures, Greenland
- Frederik Thrane from Lifestyle and Design Cluster working on circular designs out of Denmark
- Alisa Mick from Mixi Finland
- Keira Dignan from Regeneration Åland

Welcome very much to you all for this Nordic panel and this Nordic discussion. We're looking forward to hear your views.

### **Peter Munch Madsen** (Co-moderator)
And I think a great opening would be your perspective, Cathrine, on this Nordic collaboration, and having your insights while we hear what are our aims for this summit.

### **Cathrine Barth** (Natural State Norway, Nordic Circular Hotspot)
Thank you so much. I feel that the fact that we have gathered here is one of the statements we have discovered on the Nordic journey— seven years, I would say. And gathering the Nordics to know what Nordic knows in circular economy. And if there's one key takeaway that we will listen throughout the day and also tomorrow is the super skill that we can leverage is **symbiosis**. It is actually another word for how nature works in nature. We don't have a waste, but how do we organize our industries and societies for industrial symbiosis and regional symbiosis. This is maybe one of the unfair advantages we have because it's such a remote region. We live quite far apart, but let's turn this iceberg upside down and see how we can use the symbiosis as a superpower.

### **Marthe Haugland**
Thank you very much. That's a good take, and I think it's a very good way to transition to you, Edward, from your work. You're in Nalek Ventures here in Greenland, and you work with entrepreneurship in all of Greenland. And how do you balance this— building the trust in the local communities with the need for a circular business model that should scale? Do you have any thoughts on how you do this?

### **Edvard Lybert Mørk** (Nalek Ventures, Greenland)
Truly, the real infrastructure in Greenland is trust, I would say. Not the roads, not the... Yeah, trust is the real infrastructure in Greenland. Without it, we don't have any. Talking about scalable models, business models would be a tad optimistic. So we would say we understand scalable models as **adaptable models**. You know, thinking about using the Arctic strengths like reuse and resource respect and local self-reliance is some of the basis for us to start up business models here in Greenland. So very important things like those terms.

### **Marthe Haugland**
Yes, but you say that trust is the great value that we have both in Greenland and the Nordics.

### **Edvard Lybert Mørk**
Yeah, yeah, it is. Yes.

### **Peter Munch Madsen**
Okay, Frederik, you represent Lifestyle and Design Cluster. So what are your five cents on the most promising trends, changes, movements we have seen within the sector you work with, also related to circular economy, if you can.

### **Frederik Thrane** (Lifestyle and Design Cluster, Denmark)
I'd tie it in a little bit to what you just said, Edward, with taking the optimistic perspective, which is the one I'm gonna choose to take, because I do think that some of the prerequisites that need to be in place for a circular economy to work are setting root in lifestyle and design clustering.

In Copenhagen, where I work, we facilitate initiatives that tie the different players together. And we see a movement going from a lot of pilot projects, somewhat siloed sometimes, to more strategic projects that unite supply chains, that connect the dots between the different players. And that's a pretty important shift.

And I'll give you a couple of examples. As you said, Peter, we represent the lifestyle and design sector, which in Denmark predominantly means furniture and fashion and apparel. And Lifestyle and Design Cluster is facilitating two sector collaborative networks. One in the furniture sector, called the **Circular Furniture Network**, that represents 30 of Denmark's leading furniture brands, and the **Voluntary Sector Collaboration on Textiles** in the textile, fashion and apparel sector.

And what is shared between these two collaborations is that they work in a **pre-competitive framework**, meaning that competing businesses sit together in these networks and they collaborate on challenges that are too big for the individual company to face on their own. One of these areas that run through both furniture and textile is the united effort to work on creating **repair systems** that are scalable and implementable. And we have some very promising results for that. Do I have time to elaborate a little bit on that?

So we have a series of our project framework in Denmark called **Closing Loops**. It's been running for almost three years. Fortunately, it was just renewed to run for three more years. And keeping with the repair example I came with before, one of the projects within this Closing Loop framework is a project that has developed the tools, the infrastructure, and the digital platform for brands to include in their own framework to facilitate an easier and more scalable repair system. So I think that's very, very uplifting and promising. And again, it is moving from silo to more holistic, more supply chain connected initiatives.

And if I have one last second, I'm sorry to monopolize. I also see, which we're actually incredibly proud of from a Danish perspective, we see a growing interest from the government. Traditionally, the fashion and apparel sector in Denmark has not really been prioritized neither from a focus perspective or from a fiscal perspective by the government in a way that the GDP contribution from the sector should warrant, but that has changed.

So last year, there was a decision to include a **national action plan on textiles** in the Danish Fiscal Act. And this plan is focused on reduction. And that is pretty historical. So right now, the consortium, including Lifestyle and Design Cluster and the Business Association and the Knowledge Institutions, an organization called TRACE, we're working very hard to make this actually happen. And to make it broad, and to make it connected, and to make it holistic, so it goes from pilots to inclusiveness and connectedness. So that was the very long answer.

### **Peter Munch Madsen**
Thank you, Frederik, for sharing your optimistic views and also alluding to the promising Danish initiatives in this field. We also have Alisa from Finland, from Mixi. Recently, Nordic Innovation has supported Nordic Circular Investments. Maybe you could tell a bit about the project. Why are investors and circular economy so important for us?

### **Alisa Mick** (Mixi, Finland)
It's the first opportunity to speak about this project, which as mentioned is funded by Nordic Innovation. We're very thankful for that. So we have three partners: Mixi from Finland, Fund Forward from Sweden, and then Circular Norway from Norway.

And we are focused on **accelerating the investments into circular economy**. And the idea is to invite different stakeholders, financial stakeholders, so banks, venture capital funds, also corporates to bring their best cases related to circular investments. So it's also a great opportunity to invite you from here in the room, of course, but also the audience at home to join us, because we are looking for best use cases where we can learn best practices about circular investments.

The goal eventually is to have a **library with different use cases and best practices** so that financial actors can implement these best practices into, of course, circular investments. Then we're going to have a framework where we provide **KPIs** so that these financial institutions can use these KPIs when they assess and measure the impact of circular business models. And of course, the most important thing, which is related to this event, is the **network**. So as I mentioned, we invite everyone who are interested to join. We will have different events and workshops where we would like to engage with you. So, welcome.

### **Peter Munch Madsen**
Thank you, Alisa. Maybe you could tell a bit more about... When you go and present investors with the circular economy term, what are the challenges? What are the biggest challenges you see in this field?

### **Alisa Mick**
So I think that now we see a change, but for many years, circular economy has been seen as something that is **not so investable**, related, of course, to the risk. So circular investments have been seen as more risky because they require also more time. So as we know, circular business models require to educate the market. And they require, usually, they have a physical aspect, so it's not a cool software, which takes a few days, maybe. Sorry if there are software entrepreneurs in the room.

But usually circular solutions require a factory or other physical aspects that, of course, require more time. And with circular solutions, it was mentioned before, the value. So I see that circular solutions, they require the collaborations of different actors. So it takes time to build these **value networks**— different actors together to collaborate.

And what we would like to present in this project is that with circular investments we probably need **new types of investment models** which bring public investments and private investments together so that we can also lower the risk that private investors are currently seeing in circular investments. So that's our main goal.

### **Marthe Haugland**
Okay, interesting. And that brings me over to Michel. As a managing partner of the Nordic Circular Hotspot, how do you see the Nordic region positioning itself as a— could we be a testbed for circular solutions globally, you think, here in the Nordics?

### **Michel Bajuk** (CradleNet, Sweden / Nordic Circular Hotspot)
So testbedding in this context means trying, developing, trying, applying new policies, business models, new technologies, and to optimize that many things need to align. In my mind there are two critical areas.

**Number one, we have culture and mindset.** In the Nordics we are good at collaboration, design thinking, and technology. There is also trust, as you mentioned earlier, and a sense of responsibility, still being strong in our societies. Combined, this gives early adopters and innovators plenty of room for experiments and even to fail sometimes. These are key features of what constitutes an environment for good testbeds.

**However, second, politics.** The Nordics share on paper an ambition to become the most sustainable region by 2030. In practice, however, I see from my perspective, mostly short-term economic concerns being addressed. I'm happy to hear your positive view there, Frederik, on Denmark. There are circular strategies nationally, that have been adopted. They are broad in nature, they are non-binding and rather politically fragile, I would say.

By contrast, the European Union is championing circular economy. They even have an appointed **circular commissioner** who is working hard for the transition, marrying the circular issue with economics, security, geopolitical security, resilience, and other critical issues of our time. Ironically, she's Swedish. Doesn't align with what I'm hearing in the Swedish politics and discussion and debate.

So we do have an excellent environment for testbedding circular transition in the Nordics, I think. But for that to happen, **national politics need to, at the very least, align with already set targets and the ambitions of the European Union.**

### **Marthe Haugland**
Good point. And that, Keira, for youth movements, you are very demanding. You are demanding systemic change. But how can you be more involved in the policy and the realization of the ecosystems and the policymaking in the circular transition?

### **Keira Dignan** (Regeneration Åland / Regeneration 2030)
That's a kind question. Thank you. And if I can speak to you all as industry leaders and innovators, and perhaps a few politicians today, and if you just take away three things from what my generation would need in order to be involved in the planning of our future, I would say: **Invite us into the room, support us on the streets, and don't jail us.**

And to explain a bit what I mean, I'm gonna zoom out and talk about what do we mean when we say circular economy. From my perspective, I can see sort of three main ways that we use the term circular economy.

And the first is the **micro level**. It's like a consumer practice or a specific company. So for example, me choosing to reuse my water bottle rather than getting a new one— circular practice. Or H&M having drop-off points where people can bring their used clothes to be resold— circular business.

Then I would say we have the **level up from that, which is when we look at a whole economy** and we say how much of it is circular. So for example, the **Circular Gap Reports**, which are very interesting. That would be an example of this level, where we're saying, OK, the economy is about 4% circular, 96% not circular, linear.

But what I would like us to push is to think also about the **third level of circular economy, which is the system level**. And I think you're totally right, Marthe, when you say that we are asking for system change. So for us to think about how is our economy designed, how is it functioning, what are the incentives, who gets to make the decisions— these sort of **macroeconomics systems** which end up defining the success or failure of sustainable economic models.

Now, I'm up here representing **Regeneration 2030**, which is a youth network for the whole of the Nordic and Baltic Sea region. And we have 18 member organizations in our network. So each of these different youth grassroots organizations takes a different— has a very different praxis for how they're fighting for, arguing for, working towards this macroeconomic change that we want to see.

But just for some examples, there's a lot of youth groups that are working to provide **outside pressure**. This means they are disrupting and pushing on the system from the outside. So for example, **NaturUngdom**, which is a mass membership youth organization in Norway, this summer spent a lot of time blocking access to a new oil field, which they believed was illegal and was a massive threat to our generation's future. So that's sort of outsider pressure on the system.

There's also groups in our network who work **from the inside**. So for example, **Generation 2030 Finland**, our elected 30-person youth board, who participate in councils and advise the ministers of the government, including the prime minister, on various issues, but including sustainability. So we're working both outside the system and inside the system to try and see big change.

But what we see across the board is a big ambition for that big systematic change. So if you want to support us, I ask you that you **invite us into the room where the decisions are made**, so you can hear our opinions— and preferably asking organized groups rather than just like some nice, random young person. And also **don't dismiss the outside pressure** that we're putting in the streets. So even if that's not something that you are able to do, support us when we go on the streets and we take direct action. And whatever you do, **please don't jail us.** We're trying our best.

### **Marthe Haugland**
I think that's a very good— very good points. And I think back to you, Cathrine, how do you see— how do you— I mean, we are all eager for the change. We do support the youth. And how do you see the ecosystems building and how can we all move towards this change faster? You talked about industrial symbiosis. This is systemic level change.

### **Cathrine Barth**
It's indeed systemic. Now we need to understand we live in a **250-year-old linear economy**. I used to say the fish don't know what water is. So my generation really needs— it's a big task to unlearn what we have learned and grew up in, and having Keira and the young regeneration. I think this is the most important part of infrastructure. It's the **human and knowledge infrastructure**. How do we reskill our next generation and any generation time to come so we can scale faster into an economy that is in balance with the nature systems also. So I'm a big promoter to see what kind of knowledge will we need. And I'm very eager to listen and learn during these two days, how we can make that move faster.

### **Einar Kleppe Holthe**
I think that's a perfect end to the panel. Thank you very much.

*(Applause)*

Thank you so much, Marthe and Peter, for taking us through that and thanks you to all the participants and all the partners of Nordic Circular Hotspot, representing a true Nordic perspective from all the different corners and regions.

## PART 6: Reflection - The New Nordics
**Time**: 10:11 - 10:19 (8 minutes)

### **Einar Kleppe Holthe**
Keira, you talk about the Baltics very quickly. And we are talking about the **new Nordics** as where we also include the Baltics. So if you would like to come to the stage, Agita.

When we started working with the value chains of the Nordics, we saw there was a big interconnectiveness with the Baltics. And from Greenland in the West and the North and the Arctic region and the Baltics in the East. It's really important to see how we all work together. And now you have started with the three Baltic countries, a **Baltic Circular Hotspot**. And we are now collaborating to see how we can have also regional to regional collaboration in these factors. Would you like to just say a few words about that? Dear Agita.

### **Agita Baltbārde** (Baltic Circular Hotspot, Latvia)
Yes, hi, hello. Good morning, everyone. Yep. So I think we have a common ground to build upon. We have common environmental context and challenges. Because of the geographical proximity, we have climate similarities and, of course, economical interconnections.

But if I have to talk about a true circular collaboration, it begins in the moment when we create **meaningful touchpoints for sharing experiences and knowledge**. And this **Baltic Circular Hotspot**, which we together with Nordic Circular Hotspot established exactly a year ago, is a great example for such a platform.

Baltic Circular Hotspot right now focuses on collaboration within the Baltic and Nordic region and practical support for our organizations, institutions, NGOs and even policymakers. And right now, in a year, we already are establishing the first **transition group** in the **textile industry**. And I believe that very soon, the next will follow in the construction industry, I believe also in circular city life and food supply chains.

Regarding scale and impact, I believe that working together, like Baltics and Nordics, we can create a **larger market** and also **cross-border value chains**.

### **Einar Kleppe Holthe**
It's a very interesting journey that you've started. And we are, of course, trying everything we can to support with the learnings that we've had over our last five years to make your initiative in a state, maybe just one or two years, because we need to work fast together.

And when we start to work with these regional and inter-regional connectivities, and we follow the value chains, the natural resources, the human capacities, the societal interest in the market dynamics of our region, we see that there's no way out. And this is something that we have now been working together for a year. And it looks like we are managing to cut back time on establishing a transitional organization in your area.

And I think that it would be a fantastic organized collaboration, because you have to take the understanding from the local societies, the different national understandings of sovereign regions, cultures into the perspective. But if you build collaborations in collaborations, you form these dynamics of transition. I'm very glad that we are. Agita, do you think we will be able to reach our targets for next year?

### **Agita Baltbārde**
For sure, and I believe, and what we see already, that this synergy of diverse perspectives and ambitions bring us to the table where we can be in, you know, I would like to say like **win-win positions**, because you in Nordics are advancing circular economy like, I don't know, more than a decade, I believe so, and we in Baltics are, I would like to say, in a starting point.

But where you can bring your experience and best practices, we can bring maybe sometimes a **fresh perspective**. Like for this, for example, this **Latvia Circularity Report**, which I will present to you all tomorrow, is built for the Latvian municipalities, but the success of this method— the index— lies in this **adjustability, adaptability**. You can adjust these indicators of the index to any other countries according to their national priorities and challenges.

So you just talked about Nordics as a potential testbed for global arena. Then maybe I would like to say that **Baltics could be also a sandbox or a testbed** where you can challenge and try and test new circular solutions. And then before you scale it up in maybe Nordic region.

### **Einar Kleppe Holthe**
Thank you. It's wonderful to see how it kind of develops and having the Arctic-Nordic-Baltic perspective in our greater region is very important in the value dynamics of our future. So thank you, Agita, for presenting that.

## PART 7: Presenting the Programme & Reflect
**Time**: 10:20 - 10:30 (10 minutes)

### **Einar Kleppe Holthe**
And on that note, I would like to re-welcome Cathrine and Eva to the stage, because then we can actually start on the programme and talking about what we are going to talk about today. I just want to say it was deeply inspiring to hear your Minister Peter Borg's speech at the very opening of the opening session. And I'm just very glad we are here together. And we will have some very good conversations for the coming two days. Do you please want to take us through the program before we go over to a quick coffee break?

### **Cathrine Barth**
Sure. I think it's been a very long time since I've been in such a room with so much crossover knowledge. And I know, I really hope that the most important program will happen along the table and between the tables. So getting the people connected here. But on the topic notes, we are really looking forward to opening with diving into the **Circular Ocean Industries** today. That will be one of the market approaches we have on the main program.

### **Eva Jørgensen**
Next up we will have the **Locally Rooted** panel discussion— Materializing Circular Future.

### **Cathrine Barth**
And we also will have good time to delve down into the role of culture and design and see how the **Arctic Nordic Lifestyle** will matter for the transition for circularity.

### **Eva Jørgensen**
And then we are going to the **Circular Regions and Cities**.

### **Cathrine Barth**
And then when this day is over, I really hope at least everybody has one new idea, and I can't wait. And then we bridge over to tomorrow, then we split apart. Today we are all gathered to the world digitally and in the room here in Nuuk. And tomorrow we split, so we will have one session, one day with the **digital sessions**. And that is where we explore the transition groups which has been working on **circular construction**...

*(Audio becomes indistinct)*

...I'm trying. Yeah, OK. OK, then we are... There we go.

So, how do we **upscale the circular transition solutions**? And that's where lots of the larger projects on circularity and real estate are going together. Also, it will be launched the new **Circular Textile Transition Group** that is also bridging to the lifestyle from today. And the last is the digital online session on **Circular Design Toolbox**, which is how to join on more common working language and working methodologies when we want to explore and develop circular solutions.

### **Einar Kleppe Holthe**
And then here in Nuuk, for those who are physically present.

### **Eva Jørgensen**
Yeah, we have some physical sessions as well also at the Nalek Ventures meeting rooms. We have an **Arctic Approach to International Material Governance** kind of a workshop. We have **Circular Skills and Knowledge** and we have a **Circular Port Cities** session.

### **Einar Kleppe Holthe**
So it's going to be two days filled of sharing knowledge, learning together, talking about what works and what doesn't work and how we can make our systems work better with circular and sustainable approaches and principles and solutions in our markets and societies.

### **Cathrine Barth**
So on that note, Cathrine...

### **Einar Kleppe Holthe**
On that note, we will stretch our legs, we will reach out our hands and say hello to everybody who's along the same table and we'll meet again at quarter to 11 and then we will really splash down into the wonderful knowledge of ocean industries and circular economy.

See you soon. Thank you so much from Nuuk.
