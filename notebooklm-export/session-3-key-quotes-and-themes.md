**Nordic Circular Summit 2025**
**November 19, 2025 | Nuuk, Greenland**

---

## Top 10 Quotes

### 1. "We cannot mine our way out of this dependency"
**Speaker**: Mika Sulkinoja (Sitra)
**Context**: Discussing Europe's critical materials challenge
**Why It Matters**: Reframes the debate from mining vs. circularity to mining + circularity, with circularity defining the long-term path. Acknowledges we need both near-term mining and long-term circular systems.

---

### 2. "Circularity is no longer an environmental agenda. It is now a matter of competitiveness and security"
**Speaker**: Mika Sulkinoja (Sitra)
**Context**: Explaining why circular economy has become strategic imperative
**Why It Matters**: Fundamental reframing of circular economy from sustainability nice-to-have to geopolitical necessity. Changes the conversation from environmental benefits to economic survival.

---

### 3. "Money goes where value is created. It's as simple as that"
**Speaker**: Luca De Lorenzo (Nordic Investment Bank)
**Context**: Explaining investment decisions
**Why It Matters**: Cuts through complexity to the core economic truth. The challenge isn't convincing financiers to care about circularity—it's making circular models create clear value. Once value is there, finance follows.

---

### 4. "The value of resilience has increased. This is structural"
**Speaker**: Luca De Lorenzo (Nordic Investment Bank)
**Context**: Discussing supply chain changes
**Why It Matters**: Identifies the permanent shift in how businesses value supply chains. No longer optimizing purely on cost—resilience now has monetizable value. This structural change fundamentally improves the business case for circular models.

---

### 5. "Shortening supply chains has a value. And we can put a dollar or euro sign or kroner sign to it"
**Speaker**: Luca De Lorenzo (Nordic Investment Bank)
**Context**: Explaining how resilience becomes investable
**Why It Matters**: Makes abstract concept of "resilience" concrete and quantifiable. When you can put a price on supply chain security, circular business models that seemed uneconomical suddenly make financial sense.

---

### 6. "How could it be if we go together and establish an ArcCirc?"
**Speaker**: Cathrine Barth (Natural State)
**Context**: Proposing Arctic Circular Economy Resource Centre
**Why It Matters**: Bold vision for Arctic circular collaboration modeled on EU CERC. Positions 4 million Arctic residents as active agents, not passive recipients, in circular transition. Could reshape Arctic circular policy.

---

### 7. "It's complicated to apply, it's complicated to report"
**Speaker**: Anders Ladefoged (European Economic and Social Committee)
**Context**: Arctic stakeholders' feedback on EU programs
**Why It Matters**: Honest assessment of barrier to Arctic participation in EU circular initiatives. Well-intentioned Brussels frameworks don't fit Arctic administrative realities. Essential feedback for making "locally rooted" work.

---

### 8. "We need to do this [FPIC] despite the international pressure"
**Speaker**: Patrick Schroeder (Chatham House)
**Context**: Maintaining indigenous rights standards amid critical minerals scramble
**Why It Matters**: Moral stand against "race to the bottom" in mining standards. Affirms that Europe must maintain FPIC and ESG standards even when competitors don't. Values over expediency.

---

### 9. "The Arctic community is actually quite a large nation, with 4 million people"
**Speaker**: Cathrine Barth (Natural State)
**Context**: Reframing Arctic significance
**Why It Matters**: Repositions Arctic from marginal region to significant entity deserving coordinated support. 4 million is larger than many EU member states. Changes perception and potentially policy priority.

---

### 10. "Every material comes from somewhere and is going to live possibly forever"
**Speaker**: Cathrine Barth (Natural State)
**Context**: Discussing Digital Product Passport and material awareness
**Why It Matters**: Profound shift from materials as throughput to materials as permanent economic actors. Foundation for material economics, material rights, material ownership—new concepts reshaping economic thinking.

---

## Top 10 Core Themes

### 1. **Circularity as Security Strategy**
**What**: Circular economy reframed from environmental initiative to competitiveness and security imperative
**Why**: Europe's dependency on China for critical materials, tightening supply chains, strategic vulnerability
**Key Insight**: When you export the materials you need most while setting recycling targets, circularity becomes national security issue
**Quote**: "Circularity is no longer an environmental agenda. It is now a matter of competitiveness and security"

---

### 2. **Inner Loops Over Recycling**
**What**: Reuse, repair, refurbishment, remanufacturing create more value than recycling
**Why**: Remanufacturing market could grow from €31B to €100B by 2030, creating 500,000 jobs
**Key Insight**: Recycling is the last loop—strongest economic and social benefits come from keeping products in use longer
**Quote**: "The strongest economic and social benefits come from the inner loops: reuse, repair, refurbishment and re-manufacturing"

---

### 3. **Structural Shift: Value of Resilience**
**What**: Supply chains no longer optimized purely on cost—resilience has quantifiable value
**Why**: Fundamental trust in global markets broken; dependency risks exposed
**Key Insight**: This is structural and permanent, not temporary COVID/Ukraine effect. Changes investment case for circular models.
**Quote**: "The value of resilience has increased. This is structural. It's not going to go away"

---

### 4. **Mining + Circularity (Both/And)**
**What**: Need both responsible mining and circularity, not either/or
**Why**: Mining essential for near-term demand; circularity essential for long-term resilience
**Key Insight**: If rely on mining alone, stay vulnerable. If rely on circularity alone, can't scale fast enough.
**Quote**: "We need both. But circularity must define the long-term path"

---

### 5. **Investment Gap and Policy Mechanisms**
**What**: Huge investment gap requires off-take guarantees, floor prices, public procurement, recycled content requirements
**Why**: Companies shifting from "why circular" to "how to implement" but need predictable policy frameworks
**Key Insight**: Danish industry calling for far-reaching regulation means they're on board—they want stronger, clearer rules
**Quote**: "When companies start calling for things like this, it means they are on board"

---

### 6. **Indigenous Rights and FPIC**
**What**: Free Prior Informed Consent inadequately applied for 20-30 years; must improve
**Why**: 80% of world's biodiversity in indigenous-stewarded lands; critical minerals often in indigenous territories
**Key Insight**: Risk of "race to the bottom" as US, China, Middle East companies ignore ESG. Europe must maintain standards and pay higher price if needed.
**Quote**: "Can we maintain prior informed consent? Are we able to pay a higher price? We have to"

---

### 7. **EU Frameworks vs. Arctic Realities**
**What**: Brussels-designed programs well-intentioned but extremely complicated for small Arctic entities
**Why**: Limited administrative capacity, different contexts, need simpler, more adapted approaches
**Key Insight**: If want "locally rooted" to work, can't impose top-down solutions. Dialogue is opportunity, not obligation.
**Quote**: "It's complicated to apply, it's complicated to report"

---

### 8. **Material Economics Emergence**
**What**: Material journeys, material rights, material ownership, material independency as new concepts
**Why**: Digital Product Passport makes visible that materials "live possibly forever"
**Key Insight**: Shift from materials as throughput to materials as permanent actors in economy. Reshapes economic thinking.
**Quote**: "Every material comes from somewhere and is going to live possibly forever"

---

### 9. **ArcCirc Vision**
**What**: Proposed Arctic Circular Economy Resource Centre modeled on EU CERC
**Why**: Ensure 4 million Arctic residents not left in "linear lock-in"; Arctic solidarity and collaboration
**Key Insight**: Arctic as active agent, not passive recipient. Policy support, business development, knowledge sharing adapted to Arctic.
**Quote**: "How could it be if we go together and establish an ArcCirc?"

---

### 10. **Long-term Partnerships Over Trade Deals**
**What**: Circular value chains require more than normal trade commitments
**Why**: 75+ national circular economy roadmaps globally; policy-driven transformation needs stable, long-term vision
**Key Insight**: Short-term politics risk disrupting decades-long investments. Need holistic picture including climate, ecosystems, social justice.
**Quote**: "The circular economy is definitely a policy-driven transformation"

### 8. **The Linear Lock-In**
Cathrine Barth's concern that Arctic could be "left in a linear lock-in and being out on the limbs" while world transitions. Vivid image of being left behind.

### 9. **The Structural Shift**
Luca De Lorenzo repeating "This is structural" twice for emphasis when discussing resilience value. Banker's certainty that this is permanent, not temporary.

### 10. **Black Mass Paradox**
Mika Sulkinoja describing Europe exporting black mass (battery recycling material) while setting recycling targets. Perfect encapsulation of policy incoherence.
