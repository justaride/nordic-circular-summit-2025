# Session 1: Key Quotes and Themes
## Circular Frontiers - Shaping our Future
**Nordic Circular Summit 2025 | November 19, 2025 | Nuuk, Greenland**

---

## 🌟 TOP 10 QUOTES

### 1. **On Trust as Infrastructure**
> "The real infrastructure in Greenland is trust, I would say. Not the roads, not the... Yeah, trust is the real infrastructure in Greenland. Without it, we don't have any."
>
> **— Edvard Lybert Mørk**, Nalek Ventures, Greenland

---

### 2. **On Youth Demands**
> "If you just take away three things from what my generation would need in order to be involved in the planning of our future, I would say: **Invite us into the room, support us on the streets, and don't jail us.**"
>
> **— Keira Dignan**, Regeneration Åland / Regeneration 2030

---

### 3. **On Unlearning the Linear Economy**
> "We live in a 250-year-old linear economy. I used to say the fish don't know what water is. So my generation really needs—it's a big task to unlearn what we have learned and grew up in."
>
> **— Cathrine Barth**, Natural State Norway / Nordic Circular Hotspot

---

### 4. **On Symbiosis as Superpower**
> "If there's one key takeaway that we will listen throughout the day and also tomorrow, it's the super skill that we can leverage: **symbiosis**. It is actually another word for how nature works. We don't have waste in nature, but how do we organize our industries and societies for industrial symbiosis and regional symbiosis? This is maybe one of the unfair advantages we have."
>
> **— Cathrine Barth**, Natural State Norway / Nordic Circular Hotspot

---

### 5. **On Circular Economy Measurement**
> "Circular Economy goes on **kilos, not krona or dollars**. It really explains the natural resources in our systems. And that is why this is now coming."
>
> **— Einar Kleppe Holthe**, Nordic Circular Hotspot

---

### 6. **On Traditional Knowledge**
> "Greenlandic tradition in hunting and local food production are built on generations of practical experience. They reflect careful use of resources where **nothing is wasted and every part of the catch has a purpose**. This cultural foundation continues to inform how we develop food systems today, connecting tradition with modern opportunities for innovation."
>
> **— Peter Borg**, Minister, Government of Greenland

---

### 7. **On Political Alignment**
> "The Nordics share on paper an ambition to become the most sustainable region by 2030. In practice, however, I see from my perspective, mostly short-term economic concerns being addressed. We do have an excellent environment for testbedding circular transition in the Nordics. But for that to happen, **national politics need to, at the very least, align with already set targets and the ambitions of the European Union.**"
>
> **— Michel Bajuk**, CradleNet, Sweden / Nordic Circular Hotspot

---

### 8. **On Investment Models**
> "With circular investments we probably need **new types of investment models** which bring public investments and private investments together so that we can also lower the risk that private investors are currently seeing in circular investments."
>
> **— Alisa Mick**, Mixi, Finland

---

### 9. **On System-Level Change**
> "What I would like us to push is to think about the third level of circular economy, which is the **system level**. How is our economy designed? How is it functioning? What are the incentives? Who gets to make the decisions? These sort of macroeconomic systems end up defining the success or failure of sustainable economic models."
>
> **— Keira Dignan**, Regeneration Åland / Regeneration 2030

---

### 10. **On Human Infrastructure**
> "I think this is the most important part of infrastructure. It's the **human and knowledge infrastructure**. How do we reskill our next generation and any generation time to come so we can scale faster into an economy that is in balance with the nature systems?"
>
> **— Cathrine Barth**, Natural State Norway / Nordic Circular Hotspot

---

## 🎯 CORE THEMES

### **1. VALUE REDEFINITION**

**Nature as Primary Value**
- Circular economy measured in kilos (material flows) not currency
- Balance between human and nature values currently imbalanced
- Nature value becoming scarce, driving circular economy importance
- Moving from meaningless growth to sustainable development

**Quote:**
> "Value is the core essence of us. It's the value of our life. It's a nature value that we belong to, and it's really the balance between human and nature values that is now in imbalance of the old systems."
> — Einar Kleppe Holthe

---

### **2. TRUST & COLLABORATION**

**Nordic Cultural Assets**
- Trust as foundational infrastructure (especially in Arctic contexts)
- Collaboration, design thinking, technology as Nordic strengths
- Pre-competitive frameworks enabling business collaboration
- Sense of responsibility remaining strong in Nordic societies

**Examples:**
- Denmark's Circular Furniture Network: 30 competing brands collaborating
- Voluntary Sector Collaboration on Textiles
- Nordic Circular Investments project (Finland, Sweden, Norway)

**Quote:**
> "Competing businesses sit together in these networks and they collaborate on challenges that are too big for the individual company to face on their own."
> — Frederik Thrane

---

### **3. ADAPTABILITY OVER SCALE**

**Rethinking Growth Models**
- Adaptable models more appropriate than rigid scalable models
- Context matters: rural vs urban, local vs global
- Arctic strengths: reuse, resource respect, local self-reliance
- 28 million Nordic market as platform, not template

**Quote:**
> "Talking about scalable models, business models would be a tad optimistic. So we would say we understand scalable models as **adaptable models**."
> — Edvard Lybert Mørk

---

### **4. POLITICAL GAP**

**Ambition vs. Implementation**
- Paper commitments to sustainability vs. short-term economic focus
- Circular strategies broad, non-binding, politically fragile
- EU leadership (Circular Economy Commissioner) vs. national lag
- Need for alignment between national politics and EU targets

**Denmark Exception:**
- National action plan on textiles in Fiscal Act
- Government prioritizing previously neglected sectors
- Movement from rhetoric to resource allocation

**Quote:**
> "Last year, there was a decision to include a national action plan on textiles in the Danish Fiscal Act. And this plan is focused on reduction. And that is pretty historical."
> — Frederik Thrane

---

### **5. INVESTMENT BARRIERS**

**Why Circular Is "Too Risky"**
- Longer timelines required for circular business models
- Physical infrastructure needs (factories, logistics)
- Market education necessary
- Multi-stakeholder collaboration networks take time to build

**Solutions Needed:**
- Hybrid public-private investment models
- KPIs for measuring circular impact
- Best practice libraries
- Lower risk through collaborative funding

**Quote:**
> "For many years, circular economy has been seen as something that is not so investable, related to the risk. Circular solutions require a factory or other physical aspects that require more time."
> — Alisa Mick

---

### **6. YOUTH & SYSTEM CHANGE**

**Three Levels of Circular Economy**
1. **Micro**: Individual/company practices
2. **Economy-wide**: Percentage circular (currently 4% globally)
3. **System**: Macroeconomic design, incentives, decision-making

**Youth Strategies:**
- **Outside pressure**: Direct action (e.g., NaturUngdom Norway blocking oil field)
- **Inside participation**: Advisory boards (e.g., Generation 2030 Finland)
- 18 organizations in Regeneration 2030 network across Nordic-Baltic region

**Demands:**
1. Invite organized youth groups into decision rooms
2. Support street activism
3. Don't criminalize climate action

---

### **7. TRADITIONAL KNOWLEDGE**

**Arctic Circular Wisdom**
- Generations of resourcefulness: nothing wasted
- Every part of catch has purpose
- Adaptive, practical, community-driven approaches
- Cultural foundation informing modern innovation
- Self-sufficiency strategies rooted in local knowledge

**Quote:**
> "It is always a very emotional moment for me, the lighting of the lamp and the drum song. It awakens my spiritual partner inside me, my companion, the polar bear."
> — Peter Borg (describing cultural opening)

---

### **8. INDUSTRIAL SYMBIOSIS**

**Nature's Model for Economy**
- Organizing industries like ecosystems (no waste)
- Regional symbiosis across Nordic-Arctic
- Supply chain collaboration over silos
- Turning geographic remoteness into advantage

**Examples:**
- Circular Furniture Network pre-competitive repair systems
- Textile transition groups bridging sectors
- Construction sector transformative approaches

**Quote:**
> "Let's turn this iceberg upside down and see how we can use the symbiosis as a superpower."
> — Cathrine Barth

---

### **9. BALTIC-NORDIC EXPANSION**

**The New Nordics**
- Baltic Circular Hotspot established 2024
- First transition group in textiles forming
- Win-win: Nordic experience + Baltic fresh perspectives
- Baltics as sandbox/testbed for solutions before scaling
- Latvia Circularity Report: adaptable index for municipalities

**Quote:**
> "If Nordics are testbed for global arena, then Baltics could be also a **sandbox or a testbed** where you can challenge and try and test new circular solutions before you scale it up in Nordic region."
> — Agita Baltbārde

---

### **10. UNLEARNING & RESKILLING**

**Knowledge Infrastructure**
- 250-year-old linear economy embedded in thinking
- "Fish don't know what water is" - need to see the system
- Reskilling all generations, not just youth
- Human and knowledge infrastructure as critical as physical
- Moving from linear to circular mindset

**Key Transitions Needed:**

## 🎨 METAPHORS & FRAMEWORKS

### **The Fish Don't Know What Water Is**
Used to describe how we're embedded in a 250-year-old linear economy without recognizing it. We need to step outside to see the system.

### **Trust as Infrastructure**
Reframes infrastructure from physical (roads, buildings) to social (relationships, reliability). Particularly relevant in Arctic contexts.

### **Turning the Iceberg Upside Down**
Using geographic challenges (remoteness, harsh climate) as advantages for symbiotic circular models.

### **Symbiosis as Superpower**
Nature's waste-free ecosystem model applied to industrial organization.

### **Sandbox to Testbed to Scale**
Progressive model: Baltics test → Nordics validate → Global scale

### **Kilos Not Krona**
Circular economy measured by material flows (physical reality) not financial abstractions.
