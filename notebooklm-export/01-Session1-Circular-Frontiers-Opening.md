## PART 1: CULTURAL OPENING (09:15-09:22)

The summit opened with a traditional Greenlandic cultural ceremony by NAPA featuring a drum song and lamp lighting ceremony. Minister Peter Borg described the moment as deeply spiritual: "It awakens my spiritual partner inside me, my companion, the polar bear. So it was emotional."

## PART 2: MINISTERIAL ADDRESS (09:25-09:30)

### Minister Peter Borg - Government of Greenland

Minister Borg's opening address highlighted Greenland's unique position at the intersection of traditional knowledge and modern circular economy principles:

> "This year's summit marks the first time that the event is held in one of the self-governing territories of the Nordic constellation. This is an important milestone, as it reflects a willingness to engage more directly with the diverse political and geographical realities that define the broader context in which this summit operates."

**On Traditional Knowledge:**
> "Greenlandic tradition in hunting and local food production are built on generations of practical experience. They reflect careful use of resources where nothing is wasted and every part of the catch has a purpose. This cultural foundation continues to inform how we develop food systems today, connecting tradition with modern opportunities for innovation."

**On Greenland's Self-Sufficiency Strategy:**
> "Our participation is guided by Greenland's self-sufficiency strategy, which shapes the long-term development in our country. The strategy aims to reduce import dependency, strengthen local value creation, and ensure that development is anchored in Greenlandic culture."

**On Arctic Perspective:**
> "The Arctic perspective brings additional insight to these discussions. Greenland's geographic and climatic conditions create unique challenges and opportunities. Remote communities, seasonal variation, and local knowledge encourage approaches that are adaptive, practical, and community-driven."

## PART 3: NORDIC CIRCULAR HOTSPOT INTRODUCTION (09:30-09:40)

### Einar Kleppe Holthe - Nordic Circular Hotspot

Einar delivered a comprehensive presentation reframing how we think about value in economic systems:

> "We live in a 250-year-old linear economy. The fish don't know what water is. My generation needs to unlearn what we have learned and grew up in."

**On Value Chains:**
> "Nordic Circular Hotspot is about accelerating the transition to a circular and sustainable economy in the Nordics. It's about collaboration. It's about implementation—how we can actually get things done. We've been talking and strategizing for a few years, but now we need to do. And it's about value creation. Value creation is the core essence."

**On Circular Economy Measurement:**
> "Circular Economy goes on kilos, not krona or dollars. It really explains the natural resources in our systems. And that is why this is now coming."

**On the Nordic Market:**
> "We want to look at the Nordic structure as a scalable market where we can take local solutions into 28 million people, five countries, three autonomous regions, and help them create viable business solutions with circular and sustainable principles."

**Summit History:**
- 2020: Oslo (First summit)
- 2021: Copenhagen
- 2022: Stockholm
- 2023: Reykjavik
- 2024: Helsinki (during Slush week)
- 2025: Nuuk, Greenland (first autonomous region)

## PART 4: LOCAL PARTNERSHIP & BRUSSELS CONNECTION (09:35-09:45)

### Gorm Vold (Joining remotely from Brussels)

In a demonstration of the global relevance of local circular initiatives, Gorm Vold joined from Brussels where he was participating in EU-Greenland discussions:

> "The circularity in general, Nordic circularity, Arctic circularity—the knowledge and the culture behind our view is widely local but also international. Here in Brussels, we have a lot of discussions with the European Commission and the EU in general with our contribution to circularity."

Topics being discussed in Brussels:
- Hydropower and energy forms
- Digital transition
- Raw materials and minerals
- Environmental perspectives
- Greenland-EU connections

## PART 5: NORDIC INNOVATION INTRODUCTION (09:40-09:43)

### Marthe Haugland & Peter Munch Madsen - Nordic Innovation

> "Nordic Innovation offers Nordic solutions to global challenges. We are a part of the Nordic Council of Ministers, which is the collaboration between the five Nordic countries and the Arctic region. We are born to enable the vision of the Nordic Council of Ministers to create the most integrated and sustainable region in the world."

**Current Call for Proposals:**
- Total funding: 30 million NOK
- Requirement: Partners from at least 3 Nordic countries
- Focus: Green solutions ready for market by 2030

## PART 6: NORDIC ARCTIC PANEL (09:43-10:10)

### On Symbiosis as Nordic Superpower

**Cathrine Barth (Natural State Norway):**
> "If there's one key takeaway that we will listen throughout the day and also tomorrow, it's the super skill we can leverage: symbiosis. It is actually another word for how nature works. We don't have waste in nature, but how do we organize our industries and societies for industrial symbiosis and regional symbiosis? This is maybe one of the unfair advantages we have because it's such a remote region. We live quite far apart, but let's turn this iceberg upside down and see how we can use the symbiosis as a superpower."

### On Trust as Infrastructure

**Edvard Lybert Mørk (Nalek Ventures, Greenland):**
> "The real infrastructure in Greenland is trust, I would say. Not the roads, not the... Yeah, trust is the real infrastructure in Greenland. Without it, we don't have any. Talking about scalable models, business models would be a tad optimistic. So we would say we understand scalable models as adaptable models. Using the Arctic strengths like reuse and resource respect and local self-reliance is some of the basis for us to start up business models here in Greenland."

### On Pre-Competitive Collaboration

**Frederik Thrane (Lifestyle and Design Cluster, Denmark):**
> "We see a movement going from a lot of pilot projects, somewhat siloed sometimes, to more strategic projects that unite supply chains, that connect the dots between the different players. And that's a pretty important shift."

**Danish Examples:**
- **Circular Furniture Network:** 30 of Denmark's leading furniture brands collaborating
- **Voluntary Sector Collaboration on Textiles:** Fashion and apparel sector working together
- **Closing Loops Framework:** Renewed for 3 more years, developing scalable repair systems
- **National Action Plan on Textiles:** Included in Danish Fiscal Act (historical first)

> "What is shared between these two collaborations is that they work in a pre-competitive framework, meaning that competing businesses sit together in these networks and they collaborate on challenges that are too big for the individual company to face on their own."

### On Investment Challenges

**Alisa Mick (Mixi, Finland):**
> "For many years, circular economy has been seen as something that is not so investable, related to the risk. Circular investments have been seen as more risky because they require more time. Circular business models require to educate the market. And they require, usually, a physical aspect—it's not a cool software. Usually circular solutions require a factory or other physical aspects that require more time."

**Solution Proposed:**
> "With circular investments we probably need new types of investment models which bring public investments and private investments together so that we can also lower the risk that private investors are currently seeing in circular investments."

**Nordic Circular Investments Project:**
- Partners: Mixi (Finland), Fund Forward (Sweden), Circular Norway
- Goal: Library of use cases and best practices
- Framework with KPIs for measuring circular impact

### On the Policy Gap

**Michel Bajuk (CradleNet, Sweden):**
> "The Nordics share on paper an ambition to become the most sustainable region by 2030. In practice, however, I see from my perspective, mostly short-term economic concerns being addressed. Circular strategies nationally adopted are broad in nature, non-binding, and rather politically fragile."

> "By contrast, the European Union has an appointed Circular Economy Commissioner who is working hard for the transition, marrying the circular issue with economics, security, geopolitical resilience. Ironically, she's Swedish. Doesn't align with what I'm hearing in Swedish politics."

**Conclusion:**
> "We do have an excellent environment for testbedding circular transition in the Nordics. But for that to happen, national politics need to, at the very least, align with already set targets and the ambitions of the European Union."

### On Youth and System-Level Change

**Keira Dignan (Regeneration 2030):**

**Three Levels of Circular Economy:**
1. **Micro level:** Consumer practices or specific company actions
2. **Economy-wide level:** Measuring how much of economy is circular (currently about 4%)
3. **System level:** Macroeconomic design, incentives, and decision-making structures

> "What I would like us to push is to think about the third level of circular economy, which is the system level. How is our economy designed? How is it functioning? What are the incentives? Who gets to make the decisions? These sort of macroeconomic systems end up defining the success or failure of sustainable economic models."

**Youth Strategies:**
- **Outside pressure:** NaturUngdom (Norway) blocking access to oil field
- **Inside participation:** Generation 2030 Finland's 30-person youth board advising ministers

**Direct Ask to Leaders:**
> "If you just take away three things from what my generation would need in order to be involved in the planning of our future, I would say: Invite us into the room, support us on the streets, and don't jail us."

### On Human Infrastructure

**Cathrine Barth:**
> "I think this is the most important part of infrastructure. It's the human and knowledge infrastructure. How do we reskill our next generation and any generation time to come so we can scale faster into an economy that is in balance with the nature systems?"

## PART 7: BALTIC-NORDIC EXPANSION (10:11-10:19)

### Agita Baltbārde - Baltic Circular Hotspot

> "We have a common ground to build upon. We have common environmental context and challenges. Because of the geographical proximity, we have climate similarities and, of course, economical interconnections."

**Baltic Circular Hotspot Progress (1 year old):**
- First transition group forming in textile industry
- Next: Construction, circular city life, food supply chains

> "You in Nordics are advancing circular economy like more than a decade. We in Baltics are at a starting point. But where you can bring your experience and best practices, we can bring a fresh perspective."

**Baltics as Sandbox:**
> "If Nordics are testbed for global arena, then Baltics could be also a sandbox or a testbed where you can challenge and try and test new circular solutions before you scale it up in Nordic region."

**Latvia Circularity Report:**
Built for municipalities, with adjustable indicators that can be adapted to any country's national priorities.
