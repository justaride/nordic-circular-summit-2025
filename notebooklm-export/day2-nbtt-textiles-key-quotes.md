## Powerful Quotes

### Kerli Kant Hvass (Aalborg University / Revaluate)

> "The textile industry works as a system and there is no country system organized within their own borders. So we need to think across borders here."

> "No single market has scaled feedstock volumes or technology mix available to build a circular textile system alone."

> "You can collaborate only when you have trust. Trust doesn't happen itself. So we need to have space to meet, learn about each other, understand each other, discuss the challenges and build that trust."

> "In Estonia, there are now several airplanes per week arriving purely delivering Shein and Temu products. This is happening in every country. And the markets for these volumes are simply not there."

> "We can't deny that 80% are primarily sent to or exported to Africa and Asia. So a lot of the waste hierarchy steps are not taking place in our region."

> "A lot of the work being done is focusing on price and not impact. Targets are missing, unclear and unambitious, especially for waste prevention, preparation for reuse, repair and actual reuse."

### Frederik Thrane (Lifestyle & Design Cluster)

> "The first thing that we learned has been that this pre-competitive setting where competing brands that would not in a million years sit together five years ago, they're actually quite willing to sit together."

> "They're quite aware that a lot of these challenges and obstacles ahead of them are way too big for the individual business on their own."

### Betina Simonsen (CEO, Lifestyle & Design Cluster)

> "The overall theme, we believe, will be reduction. Reduction of virgin materials and consumption. That is a major theme in this whole systematic textile change to a more leaner, circular industry."

> "We need to move fast and not sit in country silos doing the same cases and pilots."

> "The data has been really a good exercise to identify the data, because many of our brands have maybe not really total view of their value chain."

### Jonas Eder-Hansen (Lifestyle & Design Cluster)

> "A shared Nordic approach could really strengthen our collective voice also in Brussels and help demonstrate that our region is ready to lead on circular textiles."

> "With these tools, we want to make circular action practical rather than theoretical."

### Emilia Jedda (Finnish Textile and Fashion)

> "The key priority should be to support and ensure that circularity and especially textile recycling become commercially and economically viable, both in Europe as well as in our region."

## Key Statistics Mentioned

| Statistic | Context |
|-----------|---------|
| **~80%** | Nordic-Baltic textiles exported to Africa and Asia |

## Central Themes

### 1. Regional System, Not Country Silos
The textile industry operates as a cross-border system. No single country has the scale, technology mix, or feedstock volumes to build circular infrastructure alone. Nordic-Baltic collaboration isn't optional—it's necessary.

### 2. Complementary Capabilities
Nordics bring design, R&D, and emerging tech; Baltics bring production capacity, manual sorting expertise, and reuse infrastructure. Together, the region has what it needs.

### 3. The 80% Export Problem
Most collected textiles leave the region entirely. The circular economy's inner loops—reuse, repair, preparation for reuse—happen elsewhere. Regional infrastructure development is critical.

### 4. Pre-Competitive Collaboration Works
Denmark's voluntary sector collaboration proves that competing brands will work together on challenges too big for individual companies. The model can scale to the Nordic-Baltic region.

### 5. EPR as Opportunity and Risk
Extended Producer Responsibility could provide the funding mechanism for circular infrastructure. But early implementations risk focusing on cost over impact, with inadequate fees and unambitious targets.

### 6. Trust as Infrastructure
Collaboration requires trust. Trust requires meeting, understanding, and building relationships over time. The NBTT platform creates space for this essential work.

## Danish Model: Three 2030 Goals

| Goal | Target | Approach |
|------|--------|----------|
| **Circular Materials** | 40% recycled content, 10% fiber-to-fiber | Catalogue of recycled materials |
| **Circular Design** | Long-life, optimal loops | Shared design guideline |
| **Circular Business Models** | Increased revenue from resale, repair, rental | Service provider catalogue |

## Key Concerns About EPR Implementation

1. **Price focus over impact focus** - schemes prioritizing cost minimization
2. **Missing targets** - especially for prevention, preparation for reuse, repair
3. **Unambitious targets** - not aligned with actual waste hierarchy
4. **Low fees** - unclear if fees cover actual costs
5. **Lack of harmonization** - different national approaches complicate cross-border flows
