## Conclusion: Numbers Tell The Story

Day 2 of the Nordic Circular Summit 2025 generated actionable data demonstrating:

1. **Scale of challenge** (80% Denmark construction reduction, 72% Norway material reduction needed by 2030)
2. **Existing assets underutilized** (200,000+ unused buildings in Norway alone)
3. **Regional collaboration emerging** (8 countries in textile group, 16 companies in construction)
4. **Tools available** (15-tool design toolbox, 15 construction solutions catalogued)
5. **Data gaps persist** (Iceland no import stats since 2010, EPR fees unrealistic)
6. **Policy momentum building** (Denmark leading in construction and textiles)

The numbers confirm what the sessions discussed: the Nordic-Baltic region has the scale, expertise, and political will for circular transition—but implementation requires coordinated regional action, not national silos.
