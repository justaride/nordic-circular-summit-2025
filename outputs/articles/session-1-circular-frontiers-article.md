# Circular Frontiers: Arctic and Nordic Leaders Chart Path to Sustainable Future

**Nordic Circular Summit 2025 opens in Nuuk with powerful call for systemic change**

*November 19, 2025 | Nuuk, Greenland*

---

In a historic first for the Nordic Circular Summit series, leaders, innovators, and youth activists gathered in Nuuk, Greenland, marking the first time the annual event has been held in one of the Nordic region's self-governing territories. The opening session, "Circular Frontiers: Shaping our Future," set an ambitious tone for two days of collaboration, learning, and action toward a truly circular economy.

## A Historic Arctic Welcome

The summit opened with a traditional Greenlandic cultural ceremony featuring NAPA's drum song and lamp lighting—a moment that Greenland's Minister Peter Borg described as deeply spiritual. "It awakens my spiritual partner inside me, my companion, the polar bear," he shared with the 100+ participants gathered in person and hundreds more joining digitally.

Minister Borg's opening address highlighted Greenland's unique position at the intersection of traditional knowledge and modern circular economy principles. "Greenlandic tradition in hunting and local food production are built on generations of practical experience," he explained. "They reflect careful use of resources where nothing is wasted and every part of the catch has a purpose."

This philosophy of resourcefulness and respect for nature formed the foundation for the day's discussions on circular innovation across Nordic and Arctic borders.

## Rethinking Value in a 250-Year-Old Linear Economy

Einar Kleppe Holthe, host and representative of Nordic Circular Hotspot, delivered a comprehensive presentation that reframed how we think about value in economic systems. "We live in a 250-year-old linear economy," he stated. "The fish don't know what water is. My generation needs to unlearn what we have learned and grew up in."

Holthe outlined Nordic Circular Hotspot's mission to accelerate the transition by focusing on value chains rather than isolated initiatives. "Circular Economy goes on kilos, not krona or dollars," he emphasized. "It really explains the natural resources in our systems."

The organization has conducted six summits since 2020, moving through Oslo, Copenhagen, Stockholm, Reykjavik, and Helsinki before arriving in Nuuk. The next three years will continue in autonomous Nordic regions, with Tórshavn, Faroe Islands planned for future events.

"We want to look at the Nordic structure as a scalable market where we can take local solutions into 28 million people, five countries, three autonomous regions," Holthe explained, "and help them create viable business solutions with circular and sustainable principles."

## From Brussels to Nuuk: Global Connections for Local Resilience

In a striking demonstration of the global relevance of local circular initiatives, Gorm Vold joined the session remotely from Brussels, where he was participating in EU-Greenland discussions on critical raw materials, renewable energy, and digital transition.

"The circularity in general, Nordic circularity, Arctic circularity—the knowledge and the culture behind our view is widely local but also international," Vold explained, highlighting how Greenland's approach to sustainability is gaining attention at the highest levels of European policymaking.

## Trust as Infrastructure: Nordic Perspectives on Scaling

The Nordic Arctic Panel brought together voices from across the region, each offering unique insights into how circular economy can scale while remaining rooted in local values.

### **Symbiosis as Superpower**

Cathrine Barth of Natural State Norway framed the Nordic advantage clearly: "If there's one key takeaway that we will listen throughout the day, it's the super skill we can leverage: **symbiosis**. How do we organize our industries and societies for industrial symbiosis and regional symbiosis? This is maybe one of the unfair advantages we have."

### **Adaptable, Not Just Scalable**

Edvard Lybert Mørk from Nalek Ventures in Greenland challenged conventional thinking about business growth. "The real infrastructure in Greenland is **trust**, I would say. Not the roads," he stated. "Talking about scalable models would be a tad optimistic. We understand scalable models as **adaptable models**."

This emphasis on adaptability over rigid scaling resonated throughout the session, suggesting a more nuanced approach to circular economy than simple replication.

## Denmark's Breakthrough: Pre-Competitive Collaboration

Frederik Thrane from Denmark's Lifestyle and Design Cluster shared promising developments in furniture and textile sectors. The **Circular Furniture Network**, representing 30 of Denmark's leading furniture brands, and the **Voluntary Sector Collaboration on Textiles** are pioneering "pre-competitive frameworks"—where competing businesses collaborate on challenges too large for individual companies.

"We see a movement going from a lot of pilot projects, somewhat siloed, to more strategic projects that unite supply chains, that connect the dots between different players," Thrane explained.

Most significantly, Denmark has included a **national action plan on textiles** in its Fiscal Act, focused on reduction. "Traditionally, the fashion and apparel sector in Denmark has not really been prioritized by the government," Thrane noted. "But that has changed. And that is pretty historical."

The **Closing Loops** framework, which has developed scalable repair systems for brands, was renewed for three more years—a sign that circular infrastructure is moving from experimental to permanent.

## The Investment Challenge: Why Circular Economy Seems "Too Risky"

Alisa Mick from Mixi Finland addressed one of the circular economy's biggest barriers: investment. Through the **Nordic Circular Investments** project (funded by Nordic Innovation with partners from Finland, Sweden, and Norway), she's working to change perceptions.

"For many years, circular economy has been seen as something that is not so investable," Mick explained. "Circular investments have been seen as more risky because they require more time."

The challenge is structural: circular business models often require physical infrastructure (factories, logistics systems), market education, and multi-stakeholder collaboration networks—all of which take longer to develop than software-based solutions.

The solution? "With circular investments we probably need **new types of investment models** which bring public investments and private investments together so that we can also lower the risk," Mick proposed.

## The Policy Gap: When National Politics Lag Behind Ambition

Michel Bajuk of CradleNet Sweden delivered perhaps the session's most pointed critique. While acknowledging the Nordic region's cultural strengths—collaboration, design thinking, trust, and willingness to experiment—he challenged the political commitment.

"The Nordics share on paper an ambition to become the most sustainable region by 2030," Bajuk stated. "In practice, however, I see mostly short-term economic concerns being addressed. Circular strategies nationally adopted are broad in nature, non-binding, and rather politically fragile."

By contrast, he noted, the European Union has an appointed **Circular Economy Commissioner** actively marrying circularity with economics, security, and geopolitical resilience. "Ironically, she's Swedish," Bajuk observed, pointing to the disconnect between EU leadership and Swedish domestic policy.

His conclusion: "We do have an excellent environment for testbedding circular transition in the Nordics. But for that to happen, **national politics need to, at the very least, align with already set targets and the ambitions of the European Union**."

## Youth Voices: "Invite Us In, Support Us Outside, Don't Jail Us"

Keira Dignan, representing Regeneration 2030—a youth network spanning 18 organizations across the Nordic and Baltic region—delivered one of the session's most memorable interventions.

She outlined three levels of circular economy thinking:
1. **Micro level**: Individual consumer choices and company practices
2. **Economy-wide level**: Measuring how much of the economy is circular (currently about 4%, according to Circular Gap Reports)
3. **System level**: The macroeconomic design, incentives, and decision-making structures

"What I would like us to push is to think about the **third level of circular economy, which is the system level**," Dignan urged. "How is our economy designed? What are the incentives? Who gets to make the decisions?"

Her generation is working both inside and outside the system. Organizations like **NaturUngdom** in Norway spent the summer blocking access to a new oil field they believed illegal. Meanwhile, **Generation 2030 Finland** has a 30-person youth board advising ministers including the Prime Minister.

Her ask to industry leaders and policymakers was direct: "**Invite us into the room where the decisions are made**—and preferably ask organized groups rather than just some nice random young person. **Support us when we go on the streets** and take direct action. And whatever you do, **please don't jail us**. We're trying our best."

The room erupted in applause.

## Expanding the Circle: Baltic-Nordic Collaboration

The session concluded with a vision of the "New Nordics"—expanding the circle of collaboration to include the Baltic states. Agita Baltbārde of Baltic Circular Hotspot, established just one year ago in partnership with Nordic Circular Hotspot, shared progress on their first transition group in the textile industry.

"You in Nordics are advancing circular economy like more than a decade," Baltbārde acknowledged. "We in Baltics are at a starting point. But where you can bring your experience and best practices, we can bring **fresh perspective**."

She proposed the Baltics as a "**sandbox or testbed** where you can challenge and try and test new circular solutions" before scaling in the Nordic region—creating a win-win dynamic.

The **Latvia Circularity Report** for municipalities demonstrates this adaptive approach, with indicators that can be adjusted to any country's national priorities and challenges.

## The Road Ahead: Knowledge Infrastructure and Unlearning

As the session closed, Cathrine Barth returned to a central theme: "I think this is the most important part of infrastructure. It's the **human and knowledge infrastructure**. How do we reskill our next generation and any generation to come so we can scale faster into an economy that is in balance with nature systems?"

The program preview promised intensive exploration of circular ocean industries, locally-rooted solutions, Arctic and Nordic lifestyles, and circular cities and regions—with the second day splitting into digital sessions on construction, textiles, and design tools, alongside physical workshops in Nuuk on material governance, circular skills, and port cities.

## Conclusion: From Rhetoric to Reality

The opening session of Nordic Circular Summit 2025 demonstrated that the circular economy conversation in the Nordic-Arctic region has matured significantly. The discourse has moved from abstract principles to concrete challenges: investment structures, political alignment, youth inclusion, cross-border collaboration, and the tension between scalable and adaptable models.

Minister Peter Borg's opening words set the tone: "When experience from various regions and sectors are shared openly, they broaden our understanding and help us see new possibilities."

In Nuuk, surrounded by the dramatic Arctic landscape, those possibilities feel both urgent and achievable. The question is no longer whether the circular economy is desirable, but how quickly the systems can be transformed—and whether political will can match the ambition of innovators, entrepreneurs, and the young people who will inherit the results.

As Einar Kleppe Holthe reminded the gathering: "In the end, it's all up to us. We are the ones taking the decision on how we want to create future value."
