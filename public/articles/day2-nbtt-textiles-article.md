In a sector facing systemic crisis, the launch of the Nordic-Baltic Textile Transition Group (NBTT) marks a watershed moment for regional collaboration. Streaming live from Nuuk, the session brought together textile industry experts, researchers, and policymakers from across the Nordic-Baltic region to establish a new platform for accelerating textile circularity.

## A Platform Born from Necessity

"The textile industry works as a system and there is no country system organized within their own borders," explained Kerli Kant Hvass, Assistant Professor at Aalborg University and founder of Revaluate. "So we need to think across borders here."

The NBTT Group, initiated by Denmark's Lifestyle & Design Cluster with support from Baltic partners, aims to create a common platform bringing together:
- Companies across the textile value chain
- Research communities
- Civil society organizations
- Public sector stakeholders

"The overall theme, we believe, will be reduction," stated Betina Simonsen, CEO of Lifestyle & Design Cluster. "Reduction of virgin materials and consumption. That is a major theme in this whole systematic textile change to a more leaner, circular industry."

## The Uncomfortable Reality: A Sector in Crisis

Hvass's presentation painted a stark picture of the textile sector's current state, drawing on years of research funded by the Nordic Council of Ministers.

### The Ultra-Fast Fashion Challenge

"In Estonia, there are now several airplanes per week arriving purely delivering Shein and Temu products," Hvass revealed. "This is happening in every country. And the markets for these volumes are simply not there."

Overproduction and overconsumption have overwhelmed end-of-life markets. With EU mandatory separate textile collection starting January 1st, 2025, the infrastructure gaps and market failures have been thrust into the spotlight.

### The 80% Export Problem

Perhaps most striking: approximately **80% of collected textiles from Nordic-Baltic countries are exported to Africa and Asia**. This means the circular economy's inner loops—reuse, repair, preparation for reuse—largely happen elsewhere.

"A lot of the waste hierarchy steps are not taking place in our region," Hvass acknowledged.

## Regional Complementarity: Why Nordic-Baltic Collaboration Works

The research revealed a natural complementarity between Nordic and Baltic textile ecosystems:

| Capability | Nordics | Baltics |
|------------|---------|---------|
| Design & R&D | Strong | Limited |
| Sorting Technology | Automated, advanced | Manual expertise, lower cost |
| Chemical Recycling | Pioneering, near-commercial | No capacity |
| Mechanical Recycling | Piloting | No capacity |
| Local Reuse | Lower (growing) | Higher |
| Production Capacity | Limited | Maintained |
| Preparation for Reuse | Underdeveloped | Higher expertise |

"Nordics lead in design, R&D, and emerging sorting and recycling tech," Hvass summarized. "Baltics still have production, are good at sorting manually, reuse and repair capacity."

The conclusion was unambiguous: **"No single market has scaled feedstock volumes or technology mix available to build a circular textile system alone."**

## A Personal Story Behind the Research

Hvass shared the origin of her textile circularity work—a moment that crystallized the region's interconnected challenges.

"In 2017, I was approached by one of the largest secondhand operators in Estonia. They had a challenge: 'Kerli, we have roughly 50 tons of used textiles. We can't find markets and we send them to landfill. Can you help us?'"

The problem: Estonian operators had been donating excess textiles to larger actors, but those actors were receiving increasing volumes from Scandinavian countries. The local market saturated.

"That project paved the way for the first Nordic Council of Ministers funded project," Hvass explained—research that would document how **Baltics represent important export destinations for Nordic textiles**, while local collection and reuse remain underdeveloped.

## The EPR Imperative—And Its Risks

Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) schemes, now being developed across all EU member states, could provide the financial mechanism to fix market failures. But implementation concerns emerged as a central theme.

### Warning Signs from Early EPR Development

Hvass identified troubling patterns:
- **Focus on price, not impact** - schemes prioritizing cost over outcomes
- **Missing and unambitious targets** - especially for waste prevention, preparation for reuse, and actual reuse
- **Unrealistically low fees** - without clarity on what expenses fees should cover
- **Lack of harmonization** - each country developing different approaches

"The EPR has a vision to create an economy for collection, sorting, reuse and all these activities," Hvass noted. "But if we look at what is happening on the market, a lot of the work being done is focusing on price and not impact."

### The Harmonization Opportunity

The NBTT Group could provide exactly what's needed: a platform for coordinating EPR development across the region.

Key questions posed to the group:
1. How do we design and harmonize our EPR schemes so they fix market failures and enable true cross-border textile circularity?
2. How do we collaborate on data, traceability, and Digital Product Passport (DPP) readiness across the region?

## Denmark's Proven Model: The Voluntary Sector Collaboration

Jonas Eder-Hansen, Senior Advisor at Lifestyle & Design Cluster, presented Denmark's **Voluntary Sector Collaboration on Textiles** as a potential template for Nordic-Baltic expansion.

### A Pre-Competitive Framework

Launched in 2022 and inspired by the UK's Textiles Pact, the collaboration brings together approximately **40 Danish companies** across apparel, home textiles, and resale segments—including competing brands.

"The first thing we learned has been that this pre-competitive setting where competing brands that would not in a million years sit together five years ago, they're actually quite willing to sit together," explained Frederik Thrane, Circular Economy Team Lead. "They're quite aware that a lot of these challenges and obstacles ahead of them are way too big for the individual business on their own."

### Three Goals for 2030

| Goal | Target |
|------|--------|
| **Circular Materials** | 40% recycled content; 10% fiber-to-fiber |
| **Circular Design** | Products designed for long life using shared guidelines |
| **Circular Business Models** | Larger share of revenue from resale, repair, rental |

### Practical Tools, Not Theoretical Frameworks

The collaboration has developed actionable resources:
- **Catalogue for Recycled Materials** - a "yellow pages" for sourcing
- **Design Guide** - aligned with EU eco-design regulation
- **Catalogue of Service Providers** - circular business model partners
- **Data Reporting Framework** - consistent, anonymized progress tracking

"With these tools, we want to make circular action practical rather than theoretical," Eder-Hansen emphasized.

### Data as Foundation

Annual data reporting has proven transformative. Companies report on specific metrics using a consistent framework (now via dedicated app rather than spreadsheets), enabling sector-wide analysis.

"The data has been really a good exercise to identify the data, because many of our brands have maybe not really total view of their value chain," Simonsen explained. "So that has been a really good exercise also to prepare for EPR."

## The Nordic-Baltic Opportunity

Eder-Hansen made the case for regional expansion:

"Many of the challenges we face in each Nordic country are the same across the region. Quite a lot of companies treat our region as one integrated market."

A shared framework could:
- Reduce duplication across national initiatives
- Create common expectations
- Support international companies operating across borders
- **Strengthen collective voice in Brussels**
- Demonstrate regional leadership on circular textiles

"A shared Nordic approach could really strengthen our collective voice also in Brussels and help demonstrate that our region is ready to lead on circular textiles," Eder-Hansen noted.

## Moving Forward: Structure and Next Steps

The NBTT Group established its operational framework:

### Meeting Format
- **Two online seminars per year** on specific themes
- **One physical meeting annually** - attached to existing regional events
- **Host country model** - each meeting features deep-dive into one country's initiatives

### Immediate Timeline
- **December 1, 2025**: Deadline for topic suggestions to steering committee
- **Summer 2026**: Conference in Riga with regional report release
- **Ongoing**: Mailing list building and stakeholder engagement

### Priority Focus Areas

Three key areas emerged from discussion:

1. **Reuse, Preparation for Reuse, and Upcycling**: Supporting local reuse models and professionalizing preparation for reuse; developing scalable upcycling value chains

2. **EPR and DPP Alignment**: Harmonizing schemes across the region to enable cross-border circularity

3. **Regional Infrastructure Development**: Strategic approach to sorting and recycling capacity development

## Trust as Foundation

Throughout the session, one theme recurred: the centrality of trust to regional collaboration.

"You can collaborate only when you have trust," Hvass stated. "Trust doesn't happen itself. So we need to have space to meet, learn about each other, understand each other, discuss the challenges and build that trust."

The NBTT Group aims to be exactly that space—a platform where competing interests find common ground, where Nordic expertise connects with Baltic capacity, and where eight countries can build what none could build alone.

## The Commercial Imperative

Finnish Textile and Fashion representative Emilia Jedda captured the stakes clearly:

"The key priority should be to support and ensure that circularity and especially textile recycling become commercially and economically viable, both in Europe as well as in our region... We wouldn't want to be in a situation where we would be heavily depending on exporting all these textile materials outside of Europe, for example to China."

This is the NBTT Group's mandate: not just collaboration for its own sake, but building the infrastructure, markets, and systems that make textile circularity work—economically, practically, and at scale.
