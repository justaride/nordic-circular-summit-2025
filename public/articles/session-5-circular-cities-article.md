# From Place to Planet: How Nordic and Baltic Cities Are Building Circular Futures

**Nordic Circular Summit 2025 explores place-based approaches to circular city development**

*Nuuk, Greenland - November 19, 2025*

## Executive Summary

In the final main session of the Nordic Circular Summit 2025, leaders from Latvia, Norway, Denmark, and Greenland converged to demonstrate a fundamental truth: circular cities are not built by centralized mandates or universal blueprints. They emerge from place-based approaches that honor local context, traditional knowledge, and community trust while connecting to global systems and best practices.

The session, "Circular Cities & Regions," brought together an extraordinary range of perspectives—from Riga's EU mission label as one of 100 climate-neutral cities, to Cesis's first Baltic bioregion centered around organic food and natural capital, to Greenland's trust-based national strategy that eschews mandatory legislation in favor of collective agreement.

Three critical patterns emerged: First, **retrofit first** is not just environmental policy but economic opportunity. Examples from London, Oslo, Riga, and Greenland's Disko Bay demonstrate that stripping buildings to their structural core and refurbishing for new life costs roughly half the price of new construction while dramatically reducing CO2 emissions. Second, **circular procurement** is the leverage point municipalities and governments must activate—embedding circularity in guidelines, creating material banks, and using the "procurement muscle" to drive market transformation. Third, **trust and community** are the foundation on which all good places are built, and transparency must be embedded in the structures themselves.

From Einar Kleppe Holthe's place economy principles—where "the language of this structure is economy, is numbers" and "the life of place is also the life of our planet"—to Inooraq Brandt's observation that "the words that come to mind when people describe this new time is actually very much in line with the very, very old time in a Greenlandic or Arctic sense," the session illuminated how place-based circular development bridges the gap between ancient wisdom and urgent necessity.

By 2030, the Nordic countries aim to be the most sustainable and integrated region in the world. This session made clear that achieving that vision requires not just innovation but also humility—the willingness to listen, learn from history, and reconnect practices that industrialization severed.

## Introduction: The Context of Place

"What to learn from cities to micro societies and villages, and how city systems can inform circular quality of lives and behavior." With this framing, Einar Kleppe Holthe, CEO of Natural State (Norway), opened Session 5 by centering the discussion around a concept often lost in circular economy discourse: **place**.

Not abstract systems. Not scalable solutions. Not universal best practices. But place—concrete, specific, contextual, cultural place. The village of 1,700 inhabitants in inland Norway where an elderly home became a model for transformation. The rural Vidzeme region of Latvia where four municipalities formed the Baltic's first bioregion. The settlements of 50 people in Greenland's fjords where "three people and a freezer" connect communities to global markets while maintaining traditional lifeways.

Place matters because, as Holthe emphasized, **"The place is where we live, and it's very important to take that into context."** Cities are not machines to be optimized. They are ecosystems of human activity, cultural identity, natural resources, and economic exchange. When circular principles ignore place, they fail. When they honor place, they unlock transformative potential.

This session explored how Arctic, Nordic, and Baltic regions can lead the transition to circular systems by connecting digitalization, infrastructure, and mobility with construction and adaptive reuse. It examined how to create urban-rural value symbiosis—ensuring that innovations in capital cities inform rural communities and vice versa. And it demonstrated how sustainable place economy principles can drive local value creation for resilient societies, integrating nature, human, and societal values with market dynamics.

The lineup reflected this geographic and thematic breadth: Tālis Linkaits from Riga Energy Agency described how Latvia's capital became one of 100 EU climate-neutral cities. Inese Suija-Markova, deputy mayor of Cesis and regional mayor of Vidzeme, shared the story of creating the Baltic's first bioregion. Inooraq Brandt, General Manager at Rambøll Greenland, brought the Arctic construction perspective, emphasizing robust design and traditional knowledge. Helle Redder Momsen from Nordic Sustainable Construction explained the cross-Nordic collaboration on LCA requirements and circular building principles. Embla Kristjánsdóttir from Greenland's Ministry for Housing presented the national sustainability strategy. And Anne Mette Christiansen from CSR Greenland and Rambøll provided closing reflections synthesizing the themes.

Together, they demonstrated that circular cities are possible not despite geographic, climatic, and cultural diversity, but because of it.

## Place Economy: Redefining Value Creation

Before diving into the specific case studies, Holthe provided a theoretical foundation that reframes how we understand economic value in relation to place. "What is the value of place? And how do you create holistic place economy principles? What is the economic consequence of awareness?" These questions guide Natural State's work across Norway, from rural regions to Oslo's international brand strategy, from coffee supply chains to cultural industries.

### The Economic Consequence of Awareness

Holthe's background in specialty coffee provides the entry point. For seven years, he managed Stockfleths, one of Norway's strongest coffee brands, and he owns Fuglen, which operates in Oslo, Tokyo, Seoul, and Jakarta with 20 years of specialty coffee experience. The work centered on **transparency trade principles, direct trade principles, and traceability principles** within global food system value chains.

"This is coffee going from producer all over the equatorial world to the consumer in the Nordics, Arctics, and the Baltics, the coffee you're having now," Holthe said. "It is a crucial culture beverage for us up here in the North. But it's also crucial to take the principles that we've been talking about with traceability, direct trade-ness, sustainability, circular principles in any of the value-producing links of the global value chain."

The key insight: **"Each value-creating link affects nature, human, and society."** This is radical transparency in global trading, applicable to local value production as well. And at the center is a simple but profound idea: **"The language of this structure is economy, is numbers."**

This is the baseline economy principle. You must learn to speak economic—circular economic—to describe values for society, for humans, with nature resource management. "That is how you explain it," Holthe emphasized, noting that the textile industry (discussed in earlier sessions) exemplified this well.

The **economic consequence of awareness** emerges from understanding the effect and cause of current systems and what sustainability actually means. This awareness informs sustainable value creation principles like circular economy, which in turn creates new sustainability economy languages. As Holthe noted, the World Economic Forum in 2019 declared **nature positive as the new climate neutral** because we've come to understand nature's value. Yet as The Economist reported just last month—and as anyone in Nuuk could sense stepping outside—we're not hitting the targets.

### Triangulating the Contextual Sustainability Offer

Circular economy principles and other sustainable economic languages inform value propositions beyond capital value: **human value, nature value, societal value alongside market value**. But these can feel abstract until you apply what Holthe calls "triangulating the contextual sustainability offer."

Take **place** (concrete, practical place), add **approach** (for instance, circular economy), and add **topic** (for instance, construction). By triangulating these three, "you can actually concretize the value proposition to such an extent that it makes meaning and gives sense to people to understand. Same with sustainable textile in the Nordics. This is how you have to work with the sense of place and place awareness."

This triangulation is critical. Place without approach is inert. Approach without topic is vague. Topic without place is abstract. But place + circular economy + construction becomes Oslo's adaptive reuse projects, Riga's circular procurement guidelines, or Greenland's renovation of housing blocks in Disko Bay.

### Life of Place: Activity, Identity, Value

Values of place constitute the core principle, emerging from place making and place branding work that Holthe's team has conducted for a decade with Oslo and other cities. The insight: **"The life of place, the city life, village life, neighborhood life, is also the life of our planet, is where you create or you have the activity."**

This is the market sphere theory, where nature, human, society, and market values intersect. "What is important with place is that in the end, it's how we belong to it," Holthe explained. "What is the feeling of place? It's the life of place. It's the life that goes on here in Nuuk that gives us the feeling."

Identity of place? Also the life of place. Value of place? **"That is the value creation activity if it's in a shrimp factory, or if it's in a culture scene, or if it's in a restaurant here, or in a hunting ground. You need to understand the human activity, and then the content is key."**

Holthe offered a poetic synthesis: **"Life is human activity on location in the economic description. But it's also time of your life. What do you want to spend your time on? And the experience consists of time and place of your life, and your quality of life. And that needs to be defined by you as an individual."**

This reframes economic development entirely. Not GDP growth. Not efficiency gains. But quality of life defined by individuals in the context of place, supported by value-creating activities that respect nature, humans, and society.

### From Theory to Economic Structure

The dynamics of place are also the dynamics of values in market and society of location. **"The function of place is transaction. The function of place is activity. Transaction in market is initiated by human activity."** From this:

- The dynamics is the life of place
- The activity is the value of place
- The values of place are the qualities of place
- The qualities of place generate the attractivity of place
- The attractivity of place is the identity of place
- **The identity identifies quality of life of place**

These are not philosophical musings but economic structures described in Holthe's 2022 publication, *The New Natural State of the Market*, which presents this as a theory of economic development of place and location. Theory, and then practice—which is where the session turned next.

## Riga's Road to Climate Neutrality

Tālis Linkaits, Senior Expert and Project Manager at Riga Energy Agency, brought the conversation from theoretical place economy to practical urban implementation. Riga has been working on sustainability and climate neutrality "continuously in a constant manner" for years, and in 2024 achieved a major milestone: **receiving the EU mission label as one of 100 climate neutral and smart cities**.

### Vision: Circular Economy Lab

"How do we achieve this climate neutrality? And circular economy is one of the topics that can help us to achieve climate neutrality," Linkaits explained. Together with stakeholders, citizens, and involved experts, Riga developed a vision: to be **"a modern driving force for circular economy innovations, a circular economy lab within the country"** and a source of inspiration for other cities, communities, and a center for innovation.

The city identified **eight thematic areas** including waste management, renewable energy, mobility and transport, culture, and business. A detailed action plan addresses challenges and circular economy issues across these areas.

### Three Work Directions

Riga's approach operates along three parallel tracks:

**1. Citizen Engagement**

"It's a lot similar to what we were discussing in the previous session here today," Linkaits noted, "that basically we have somewhere in the background this knowledge about circularity in our daily life. But especially in urban environment, it's somehow forgotten." The solution: **"Get back to the basics, to talk about household-based separation, to talk about reuse of the different items in a daily life."**

Urban environments create distance between people and circular practices. Food comes from supermarkets, waste disappears into trucks, materials arrive from unknown sources. Riga's citizen engagement work reconnects urban residents with fundamental circular principles they may have learned but no longer practice.

**2. Municipality Resources**

The goal: **"Embed circularity in our daily management practices, in our procurement guidelines and principles, and also in the use of our assets."** A key innovation is creating a **material bank** where departments and divisions can share assets and inventory within the municipality as a company. This internal circular economy reduces redundant purchasing and maximizes asset utilization.

**3. Circular Businesses**

Rather than funding circular activities, Riga takes a different approach: **"Be more as a moderator, as a stimulator, as an influencer, as a networking community."** The role is business networking—gathering like-minded businesses, identifying synergies, and sharing good practices. The city becomes the convener and catalyst rather than the financier.

### Practical Examples

"To be very practical," Linkaits said, offering concrete instances of Riga's work:

**Circular Construction Guidelines**: Developed with the construction community and now used in procurement practices. These guidelines embed circular principles in how the city commissions buildings.

**Real Estate Transformation Pre-Study**: Similar to examples Holthe had shared, Riga conducted a pre-study on transforming a real estate property into a social care house "using all the circularity principles using all the available materials within this house." The subsequent procurement for reconstruction is being prepared based on circular criteria.

**Urban Resource Centers**: Learning from Nordic cities, Riga established its first urban resource center—not only a repair facility but a **community center** where circular design principles were applied from the beginning. **"This public circular procurement case was regarded as one of good practices and added to the EU database for good circular practices."**

At the center, citizens receive guided knowledge on repairing equipment, materials, chairs, tables, and more. It's also becoming a local community hub with lectures and activities. "We are involving our youth and students in different events and practices," Linkaits added. The city organized competitions where design university students competed to provide solutions implemented in the resource center.

**School Competitions**: For the second year, schools competed on best uses of circular principles in daily school life.

**Library Garden**: In one neighborhood, Riga is creating a unique outdoor area using circularity principles—a place where people can gather during summer, listen to concerts and discussions, and integrate library and cultural activities. Opening is planned for next spring.

### Latvian Circular Economy Forum

The culmination of this work came a few weeks before the Nordic Circular Summit: the **first Latvian Circular Economy Forum**. "Which was so popular that we had to cut the number of participants and speakers, but still there were **108 speakers and 34 thematic sessions**," Linkaits said with evident pride. "People were willing so much to come and tell their own stories."

The forum included business case studies, universities, NGOs, and the public sector. "All of what we do, we do basically **not from the public funding, but by attracting different EU funds and different sponsors and grants**, and we hope to continue in such a way also in the future," Linkaits concluded.

This funding model is significant. Rather than depending on municipal budgets (always constrained), Riga leverages EU structural funds, project grants, and private sponsorships to build circular infrastructure and programs. The city becomes a strategic broker, identifying opportunities and assembling resources.

## Cesis: The First Baltic Bioregion

If Riga represents the capital city approach to circularity, Inese Suija-Markova brought the rural and regional perspective—demonstrating that some of the most innovative circular developments are happening outside metropolitan centers.

### A Region Rich in Nature, Facing Rural Challenges

Suija-Markova serves dual roles: deputy mayor of Cesis municipality (90 kilometers northeast of Riga) and, since August 2024, regional mayor for the entire Vidzeme region. "I was born in that town and municipality," she said, "and I must say **I'm deeply in love with that region** because it's the region that is very rich in nature. It is really a beautiful landscape, forests, meadows. It boasts clean air and a deep sense of community. And it is a region with very strong cultural traditions and natural beauty."

But Vidzeme shares challenges faced by rural areas across the Nordic and European landscape: **sparse population, aging demographic, limited economic scale, and concentration of research and innovation institutions in the capital city**.

"Working in such a context teaches you, first of all, to be resourceful," Suija-Markova reflected, "but you learn very that **you must prioritize and above all that you have to be open to cooperation**." The fundamental insight: **"We cannot excel in every area being all alone."** By working together, small regions achieve more than they could in isolation. This philosophy has made Cesis and Vidzeme super-active in international cooperation and trusted partners in many projects.

### Defining a Bioregion

In October 2023, four municipalities from Vidzeme region joined forces with farmers, NGOs, entrepreneurs, researchers, and residents to form what Suija-Markova proudly announced as **"the first bioregion in the Baltic States and Latvia."** Centered around **Gauja National Park** (the oldest and largest national park in the region), the bioregion represents a fundamentally different organizing principle.

"By definition, **a bioregion is not an administrative unit**, although we are located in four municipalities," Suija-Markova explained. "It is a **geographic and cultural space where public authorities, farmers, tourism operators, businesses and citizens agree to manage local resources sustainably based on ecological principles and shared responsibility**."

This is critical: the bioregion operates through voluntary agreement, not governmental authority. It exists where institutions and individuals choose to align around shared ecological principles.

### Memorandum of Goodwill: A Social Contract

The foundation is a **memorandum of goodwill**, crafted over one year with every word agreed by stakeholders. Thirteen institutions representing public, private, non-governmental, and academic sectors signed on. **"In essence, it's a social contract,"** Suija-Markova said. "It's a social contract, a public commitment to create a cleaner, healthier and more circular region."

The memorandum establishes **six principles** for working together and defines **eight working directions or priority areas**:

1. Increasing access to healthy, organic food
2. Developing short food supply chains
3. Managing natural capital through ecosystem services
4. Reducing waste
5. Accelerating energy efficiency and renewables
6. Providing sustainability education
7. Fostering authentic and nature-friendly tourism
8. (Additional eighth area detailed in implementation)

"So it's a very holistic approach how we want to develop our place to address the challenges that I mentioned," Suija-Markova summarized.

### Three Practical Examples

Time constraints meant Suija-Markova could highlight only three practices since the memorandum's signing:

**1. Locally Produced Organic Food in Public Institutions**

"We are gradually transforming our procurement system to procure food for our schools and kindergartens," she explained. The goal: **"Increase the proportion of locally grown and locally produced food, organic ingredients, to replace the anonymous supply chain of products to our school meals and kindergarten meals."**

One school is working toward becoming **the first organically certified school kitchen in Latvia**. The shift reduces transport-related emissions, provides healthier food for children, and keeps more economic value within the region.

**2. Waste Reduction and Circular Economy Center at the Landfill**

"Another big direction where we work is waste reduction and development of the landfill where all the waste from the region comes into **circular economy center**," Suija-Markova said. This represents a conceptual shift: **"Looking at waste as a resource and developing new products based on these waste streams."**

Rather than simply managing disposal, the landfill becomes a site of transformation and value creation.

**3. Financial Instruments and LEADER Integration**

The bioregion is developing **new financial instruments** like municipal grants to support circular businesses. Drawing on experience from Austrian colleagues, they've integrated bioregion principles into the **LEADER program**—EU funding for local and rural development. "It's been mainstreamed into LEADER funding strategies," Suija-Markova noted. "And I think that's a great success."

### Strategic Alliance Based on Shared Values

Her closing synthesis captured the bioregion's essence: "It is a **strategic alliance based on shared values** and really the aim to be in touch with the nature, to live in accordance with the nature, to respect the environment where we live, because we see what's happening around the world and what kind of challenges we are facing."

This is place-based circular economy at its most integrated—not imposed by regulation but chosen by communities who recognize their shared dependence on local ecosystems and their collective ability to manage resources sustainably.

## Arctic Construction Wisdom

When Einar Kleppe Holthe invited Inooraq Brandt to the stage, he framed the question: "Public frontrunners, a capital city and a municipality, working with circular approach. And you work with Rambøll here in Greenland. How do you see this happening in the Arctic context?"

Brandt's response immediately clarified his position: **"Unlike my fellow panelists, I do not represent a public or government entity. I work on a commercial level and do consultancy."** As General Manager of Buildings at Rambøll Greenland, his perspective comes from providing services to public entities and, through that experience, challenging customers to push for more circularity.

### "As a WIC, We Can Use Almost Anything"

Brandt began by acknowledging a comment from the morning's lamp-lighting ceremony: **"As a WIC, we can use almost anything."** (WIC is a Greenlandic term.) "And that's actually something that is very detrimental—well, a principle for living in these regions," Brandt explained. **"We essentially come from a place where how can I construct any piece of equipment or whatever in a robust way that I ensure that I'm also able to maintain? Because our survival essentially depends on it."**

This is the Arctic imperative: you cannot rely on external repair. You cannot wait for parts to arrive. You must build things that you can maintain yourself, with available materials, in extreme conditions. Survival depends on it.

### Old Time, New Time, Very Old Time

Brandt picked up on language Holthe had used about transitioning "from the old time to the new time." He made an assumption: "The old time in that regard was the industrialization period, and the new time is what is ahead."

But here's the insight: **"The words that come to mind when people describe this new time is actually very much in line with the very, very old time in a Greenlandic or Arctic sense."**

The "new" circular economy principles—resource efficiency, waste reduction, design for longevity, community-based systems—are actually ancient Arctic practices. **"How do we make use of what we have in a way that's not going to restrict future generations from doing what they need to do?"** This has always been the Arctic question.

### Robust Solutions for Remote Contexts

"When we're doing constructions up here, I think one of the most important things is that we need to make sure that **we are constructing something in an efficient manner**," Brandt said. "We are often building in remote areas where a carpenter might not be able to come by next week. So **it's important to have robust solutions**. And we need a high level of detail in what we're doing."

The context matters enormously. "We are in Nuuk now. That is essentially a metropolis. But if you go two hours by boat into the fjord here, you will come to a small settlement with, what's it, 50 people or something like that?" The differences in living conditions are dictated not just by climate but by population size and access to infrastructure.

### Population Scale and Material Pragmatism

Brandt looked up a statistic that he wrote down because it surprised him: **"The population of Greenland is about 0.00068% of the world population."** Broaden to the complete Arctic and it's still only 0.05%. "So we are quite few people. We live in a huge area with a very low density of population."

The implication: **"We might not have the best result from trying to put our efforts into innovating new specific high-tech materials. We are very much focused on how do we utilize applications of whatever material is available."**

This is resource pragmatism born of necessity. With such small populations spread across vast distances, investing in material innovation makes less sense than mastering the application of available materials. "I can't help but think that **a lot of the things that we do in a traditional sense is actually something that might provide insight to how other regions of the world might also develop their view on circular economy**," Brandt reflected.

### Design for Disassembly: Father's House

Brandt shared a personal story that perfectly illustrated traditional circular thinking: "My father was born in a very small settlement in '45. I've never been there, '48 they moved away. I was born in '81, we never got back to where he was born. When I was an intern, I had the chance to go there and I said, 'Dad, where's the house you were born in?' And he said, 'Well, I don't know.' And his older sister was in the room and she said, **'The house, we brought it.'"**

The family home was constructed in a way that it could be disassembled and moved when the family relocated. **"So the way that their home was constructed essentially what we are talking about today, how do you design for disassembly?"** Brandt acknowledged that this won't be possible for every building, "but I think this is some of the things that we might be able to contribute with on a larger scale, the ability to build something that in a sense is reusable in other settings that might come in the future."

### Renovation Economics in Practice

Holthe asked how building repurposing is approached in Greenland. Brandt noted that Embla Kristjánsdóttir would address this in her national strategy presentation but offered a preview: **"In a sense we've had a lack of maintenance of a lot of our buildings. So we're trying to catch up on that."**

The positive trend: **"The larger focus that we are seeing on maintenance and renovation and transformation is very positive."** And there are concrete examples. "We have examples with housing blocks in the **Disko Bay area of Greenland**, where we are essentially **stripping down to the main constructions of the building, refurbishing it for a new life at about half of the cost of building a new building**."

This is the economic case for renovation: 50% cost savings compared to new construction. "And given that **the structural parts of a building is also where you have the largest CO2, especially when it's concrete**, I think that's a thing we have to pursue more," Brandt concluded.

## Nordic Construction Collaboration

Helle Redder Momsen brought a pan-Nordic perspective as Head of Secretariat for Nordic Sustainable Construction, a collaboration involving construction authorities from all Nordic countries and regions. She works for the Danish Authority of Social Services and Housing but emphasized that this is a collective Nordic effort.

### The 2030 Vision

Momsen asked the room: "How many of you know about this vision?" A few hands went up. She explained: **"Within five years, the Nordic countries have this vision of being the most sustainable and integrated region in the world."**

That's ambitious. "I work with construction. I really like buildings and our built environment a lot, and I also think it's key for us to be able to reach that very important vision," Momsen said.

### Ministers' Declaration: Focus on Existing Building Stock

The Nordic Ministers for Housing and Construction have made several declarations, the latest from 2023. Momsen highlighted one critical point: **"Recognize the potential in preserving and developing the existing building stock, and its contribution to reduced emissions."**

This links directly to the session's earlier themes—renovation, transformation, adaptive reuse. "I think that links well to the last comment from the panel on using the existing building stocks," Momsen noted. "I hear that there's a lot of good potential here, and Embla will tell you more on that."

### Toolbox for Future-Proofed Construction

The Nordic Sustainable Construction collaboration started in 2021 with five work packages. The 2024 phase concluded by gathering key findings in a report: **Toolbox for Future-Proofed Construction**. "I think there's a lot of really, really important knowledge in that," Momsen said, noting significant effort from contributors including Marte (sitting in the audience) and many others.

### LCA Calculations: Leading Global Change

One of the most significant developments in construction is the requirement to calculate climate impact across all phases—from raw material extraction through processing, transport, construction, use, and end-of-life. This is **Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)**.

**Sweden** was first to mandate by law that when you build new, you must calculate. A few months later, **Norway** followed with the same requirement. Then **Denmark in 2023** went further: not only must you calculate, but there's a **limit to how much CO2 equivalents you can emit** per square meter.

The trend is spreading globally. **Iceland** introduced requirements in September 2024. **Finland** has sent regulations to EU notification; calculations will be required, and limit values will be set by 2026. At the EU level, by **2028 buildings larger than 1,000 square meters must calculate**, and by **2030 all countries must plan toward 2050 limits**.

### Harmonizing Nordic Approaches

The Nordic countries worked together to harmonize calculation methods. "How do you calculate? 'Cause you can do that in really many ways," Momsen explained. The collaboration produced common knowledge that informed regulation across countries. **"It is not the same, but it could have been much, much, much, much, much more different."**

One critical question: **what about reused products?** What should they calculate for? "In Denmark, we were investigating that as part of setting the limit value. So we asked our colleagues, how do you set it? And more or less everyone wanted the political push that **it should be set to zero**."

This is not the real number—of course there are emissions when removing and reusing products—but **setting reused products to zero creates a powerful incentive**. Some countries calculate transport, but the core principle stands: reused products receive preferential treatment in LCA calculations.

### Three Work Packages for 2024-2027

In August 2024, the Nordic Ministers of Housing and Construction met in Göteborg and decided the collaboration should continue. The focus: **accelerate the green, circular, and digital transition**.

Three work packages guide the work:

1. **Climate/LCA** (Iceland lead): Making LCA calculations more efficient and effective
2. **Circularity** (Denmark lead): Policy measures to better utilize existing building stocks
3. **EU Coordination** (Sweden lead): Aligning Nordic approaches with EU regulations

"All the Nordic countries and regions, construction authorities, are part of this," Momsen clarified. The countries listed are simply those leading specific work packages; all provide input.

### Circularity Work Package: Policy Measures Catalogue

Momsen focused on the circularity work package, which involves four main tasks. The first: **identifying what policy measures authorities have to motivate better utilization of existing buildings**.

A few weeks before the summit, the collaboration held the **Nordic Climate Forum for Construction**, gathering Nordic construction authorities, the EU Commission, and key stakeholders. All day, stakeholders presented what they do to make it easier to use existing building stocks. "We gathered it all," Momsen said, with recordings and slides available online.

The initial mapping identified policy measures across several categories:

- **Lifetime extension**
- **Minimize unnecessary demolition**
- **Remove barriers for efficient renovation**
- **Multiple use** (how to use square meters more efficiently)
- **Incentives and tax instruments** (individual to each country but important tools)
- **Design optimization**
- **Design for disassemble** (as mentioned by Brandt)
- **The procurement muscle** (using public procurement to drive change)
- **Research, demonstration, and piloting**

"All of these measures we are working on," Momsen explained. "We're trying to see **how can we make a catalogue that can be inspiration for all the Nordic countries**, but also other stakeholders who are interested in paving the way for the existing buildings."

### Educational Program in Six Languages

In the previous phase, the collaboration created an **educational program** for vocational teachers who teach carpenters and bricklayers. "They often don't have much material on how to teach sustainable construction," Momsen noted. The program focuses on reuse and is available online in **six Nordic languages** (not Greenlandic, but including English). "It's freely available and we think it's quite good."

## Greenland's Trust-Based Strategy

Embla Kristjánsdóttir, Head of Department for Construction at Greenland's Ministry for Housing, Infrastructure and Outer Districts, presented the **national sustainability strategy for the construction and civil engineering sector**, formally approved in 2024.

### Shared Framework, Not Mandatory Legislation

The strategy's starting point reflects Greenlandic values: **"The political ambition and a clear need for a shared framework for the work ahead."** It acknowledges the international reality where sustainability is a competitive parameter (especially for private or EU funding) while respecting Greenlandic context with unique geographic, climatic, and logistical conditions.

"We're a small industry with a **strong sense of community**," Kristjánsdóttir explained. "There's a lot of trust between all of us working in this industry, as Inooraq also talked about."

The critical decision: **"So we must succeed together. This also includes that we're not gonna, at least for now, put in some legislation concerning sustainability. We should be able to do this together and agree on all of those things."**

This is a fundamentally different approach from EU mandates or Nordic regulations. Instead of top-down legislation, Greenland's strategy relies on **collective agreement enabled by community trust**. It's a holistic approach to sustainability across the entire sector.

### Guiding Principles

The strategy establishes three guiding principles:

1. **Sustainability, including initiatives to reduce CO2 emissions, becomes an active and permanent element of all government construction and civil engineering projects**
2. **Create healthy, high-quality buildings and homes that benefit both society and users today and especially for future generations**
3. **A shared understanding of sustainability is established across the sector** (an agreement among all)

### Purpose and Vision

The purpose: **"Launch and contribute to a sector-wide dialogue for the future direction of the industry and how more sustainable development can be supported in practice."** As Brandt mentioned earlier, "in practice in Greenland is sometimes a bit challenging." But the ambition is to **"create a common foundation on which the entire industry can continue to build together."**

The vision reads: "The construction sector of the future operates with consideration for future generations. **The needs of the present must be met without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.**"

This leads to specific commitments that the sector must:
- Develop and use sustainable and innovative solutions
- Contribute to growth and development throughout the country
- Reflect Greenland's culture and support local communities
- Contribute to a better climate and environment
- Be regarded as part of a global world that takes responsibility and actively participates in global developments

"It's a very strong vision for a small industry," Kristjánsdóttir acknowledged, "but we have set some goals in the strategy."

### Six Goals

Rather than overwhelming the sector with dozens of targets, the strategy establishes six clear goals:

1. The government, as public developer, must actively contribute to sustainable development through construction projects based on a holistic approach
2. The construction sector must establish a joint forum for dialogue and cooperation on sustainability
3. The sector must develop systematic methods and tools to measure and assess sustainability and sector-wide emissions
4. The sector must determine its environmental and climate impact, including CO2 emissions, set concrete targets and initiatives to reduce these
5. The sector must jointly define specific objectives and initiatives for the development of more sustainable constructions
6. (Implied sixth goal related to implementation)

"It's not many goals, which is also our purpose," Kristjánsdóttir emphasized. **"It should be goals that we can actually meet."**

### Seven Concrete Initiatives

The strategy outlines seven concrete initiatives:

1. **Principles for sustainability**
2. **Prioritization of art and architecture** in government construction projects
3. Development of a **national DGNB system** (certification system)
4. Development of a **shared methodology for Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) calculations**
5. Establishment of a **Council for Sustainability** within the construction sector
6. Preparation of an **action plan for reducing CO2 emissions** in the construction sector
7. (Seventh initiative related to monitoring and communication)

### Implementation Progress

The **DGNB system development** is well underway. A conference is planned for early December 2024 "where we're gonna go through where are we at, and I think it's meant to be the final dialogue before it is."

Importantly, Kristjánsdóttir clarified: **"The government is not gonna do certified projects. We're gonna go with the DGNB standard, but we're not gonna get the certification. It doesn't really give anything of value to us."** The standard provides the framework; formal certification adds bureaucracy without sufficient benefit for government projects. "But it needs to be in place for especially private projects."

Within DGNB development is also the **shared LCA methodology**, which will be presented in December.

The **Council of Sustainability** was established in 2023 and has held two meetings. Most discussion focused on **"how we're gonna get to the CO2 action plan because we don't have any data at the moment."** This is the starting challenge: establishing baselines when comprehensive data doesn't yet exist.

"But we're well on our way since last year, and we'll continue," Kristjánsdóttir concluded.

## Retrofit First: Economics of Renovation

Across all the presentations, one theme emerged with remarkable consistency: the economic and environmental case for **retrofitting existing buildings rather than constructing new ones**. This isn't just environmental idealism—it's sound financial practice.

### London's Regulatory Shift

Einar Kleppe Holthe referenced London's transformation: In 2020, the city implemented a regulatory requirement that **you have to retrofit the buildings first**. "It completely changed the scene," Holthe said. This regulatory approach makes renovation the default, not the exception.

### Oslo's Circular City Development

Holthe's work in Oslo demonstrates circular economy as the driver for "the biggest sustainability city development projects in Norway." Examples include:

- **Office to elderly home transformation**: A pilot client wanted to transition an old office building to a public-funded elderly home with collective living. **"The economic result is one of best practices within real estate development, because you are able to keep the resources and create societal relevance."**

- **Old factories to vibrant communities**: Transitional programs that take abandoned factories and create hubs for travel, leisure, innovation, and local production, plus residential and hotel uses.

- **Rural elderly home**: In a municipality of only 1,700 inhabitants, transformation created an attractive living home and helped attract new residents to sustain staffing needs.

The pattern: **"When you transform the buildings and fill it with the new life, storage to life, you get a completely different economic perspective, and you increase the value of the property."**

### Riga's Pre-Study Approach

Tālis Linkaits described Riga's systematic approach: conducting pre-studies using circular principles before transforming real estate to social care uses. The methodology ensures that circular thinking is embedded from the planning stage, not added afterward.

### Greenland's 50% Cost Savings

Inooraq Brandt provided the most concrete economic data: renovation projects in Greenland's Disko Bay area are **"stripping down to the main constructions of the building, refurbishing it for a new life at about half of the cost of building a new building."**

This is the business case distilled: renovation costs 50% of new construction while delivering comparable or better outcomes. And since "the structural parts of a building is also where you have the largest CO2, especially when it's concrete," keeping those structures dramatically reduces emissions.

### Nordic Ministers' Declaration

The 2023 declaration from Nordic Ministers for Housing and Construction emphasized: **"Recognize the potential in preserving and developing the existing building stock, and its contribution to reduced emissions."** This high-level political commitment backs the technical and economic case.

### The Compounding Benefits

Renovation delivers multiple values simultaneously:

- **Economic**: 50% cost savings (Greenland example)
- **Environmental**: Dramatically lower CO2 (avoiding concrete production)
- **Social**: Maintaining neighborhood character and community
- **Cultural**: Preserving architectural heritage and place identity
- **Speed**: Often faster than new construction
- **Risk**: Lower uncertainty than new builds

The combination makes retrofit-first not a niche strategy but a mainstream economic opportunity.

## Circular Procurement in Practice

If retrofit-first is the what, circular procurement is the how. Multiple speakers emphasized that municipalities and governments hold enormous leverage through procurement—what Helle Redder Momsen called **"the procurement muscle."**

### Riga's Multi-Faceted Approach

Tālis Linkaits detailed several procurement innovations:

**Circular Construction Guidelines**: Developed with the construction community and now embedded in procurement practices. When Riga commissions a building, the procurement documentation includes circular requirements from the start.

**Material Banks**: Planning to create material banks where municipality departments share assets and inventory rather than each purchasing new. This internal circular economy reduces costs and demonstrates circularity in practice.

**Real Estate Transformation Procurement**: The pre-study for transforming a building to social care use "using all the circularity principles using all the available materials within this house" is now informing the procurement for actual reconstruction.

**Urban Resource Center**: Circular design principles were applied from the beginning when designing this facility, making it a **good practice case in the EU database** for circular public procurement.

### Cesis's Organic Food Procurement

Inese Suija-Markova described transforming procurement for schools and kindergartens: **"Gradually transforming our procurement system to procure food for our schools and kindergartens, and the purpose is to increase the proportion of locally grown and locally produced food, organic ingredients."**

This replaces anonymous supply chains with known local producers, reduces transport emissions, provides healthier food, and keeps economic value in the region. One school is working toward becoming the first organically certified school kitchen in Latvia.

### Embedding Circular Criteria

Anne Mette Christiansen, in her closing reflections, highlighted "the inclusion of **circular criteria in public tenders**" as essential. This isn't a nice-to-have add-on but a structural requirement that shapes what suppliers offer.

### Why Procurement Matters

Public procurement represents enormous market power. When municipalities and governments require circular approaches, they:

1. **Create demand** that justifies supplier investment in circular capabilities
2. **Set standards** that private sector often follows
3. **Demonstrate feasibility** by implementing circular projects at scale
4. **Build supply chains** of circular products and services
5. **Establish price benchmarks** showing circular approaches are economically viable

As the Nordic Ministers recognized, procurement is not just purchasing—it's market shaping.

## From Rural to Urban: Place-Based Symbiosis

One of Einar Kleppe Holthe's framing questions asked how to **"create urban and rural value symbiosis in the villages, societies and cities"** of the Arctic, Nordic, and Baltic regions. The session demonstrated that this symbiosis isn't theoretical but operational.

### Urban Learning from Rural

**Cesis's bioregion** provides a model that urban areas can adapt: memorandum of goodwill establishing shared values, integration with existing funding mechanisms (LEADER), and focus on short food supply chains and local organic production. Cities can learn from this stakeholder-driven, place-based approach.

**Traditional Arctic practices** that Inooraq Brandt described—robust design, design for disassembly, maintenance-first thinking—apply equally to urban contexts. The constraint of limited access to repair services in remote settlements is increasingly relevant in cities as craftspeople become scarcer and supply chains more fragile.

### Rural Learning from Urban

**Riga's urban resource centers** demonstrate community repair facilities that rural areas are adapting. The combination of repair services and community gathering space works in villages as well as neighborhoods.

**Digital Product Passports and LCA calculations**, being implemented at city scale (as discussed in the Nordic collaboration), create transparency that benefits rural producers by making their lower transport emissions and local sourcing visible and valued.

**Circular procurement guidelines** developed in Riga can be adapted by smaller municipalities with less capacity to develop such frameworks independently.

### Bidirectional Knowledge Flows

The symbiosis is bidirectional:

- **Urban→Rural**: Infrastructure standards, digital systems, regulatory frameworks, market access
- **Rural→Urban**: Traditional knowledge, place-based practices, community trust models, ecosystem awareness

Neither is superior. Both are necessary. As Lise Lotte noted in the previous session, "We have two ears and one mouth"—urban and rural must listen to each other at least as much as they speak.

### Scale-Appropriate Applications

What emerged clearly: circular solutions must be **scale-appropriate**. Riga's material bank works at city scale with multiple departments. Cesis's bioregion works at regional scale across four municipalities. Greenland's 38 outposts (sometimes "three people and a freezer") work at settlement scale.

The principles are consistent—circular flows, local value retention, waste as resource, community benefit—but the implementation varies enormously by place, population, and infrastructure.

### The Locally-Rooted-Globally-Connected Model

As Kristian Ottesen noted in Session 2 (referenced by panelists), Royal Greenland's 38 outposts mean that "even the smallest settlements in Greenland have actually a global market reach in a way. So it's kind of beautiful."

This is the model: **locally rooted, globally connected**. Not choosing between local and global, but integrating both. Small communities maintain their lifeways and connection to place while participating in global value chains on terms that work for them. Cities maintain their innovation capacity and scale advantages while learning from place-based rural wisdom.

## Key Insights and Takeaways

### Trust as Foundation

Einar Kleppe Holthe's statement bears repeating: **"For the most important thing you have to build when you build places is trust. And that is what we've been talking most about today. If you don't have trust, you don't manage to create any good place."**

Greenland's national strategy embodies this by eschewing mandatory legislation in favor of collective agreement. Cesis's memorandum of goodwill creates trust among 13 diverse institutions. Riga's role as "moderator, stimulator, influencer" for circular businesses builds trust rather than imposing requirements.

Trust enables risk-taking, experimentation, knowledge-sharing, and collaboration—all essential for circular transitions.

### Communication and Culture as Key

Holthe emphasized: **"Communication and content is key, where culture is key to understand in a place-based approach with contextual and cultural understanding. If you don't bring that into the proposition, you're losing the value proposition."**

This explains why cookie-cutter circular economy programs fail. Without respecting local culture, understanding local context, and communicating in locally meaningful ways, even technically sound circular interventions won't be adopted.

Inese Suija-Markova's bioregion centers around cultural traditions and natural beauty. Inooraq Brandt's construction perspective honors traditional Arctic practices. This isn't nostalgia—it's pragmatic recognition that culture shapes behavior far more than regulation.

### Quotas as Design Features

While not explicitly discussed in this session, the principle from Session 4 applies here: constraints can be design features rather than problems to solve. Greenland's small population (0.00068% of the world) means, as Brandt said, **"we might not have the best result from trying to put our efforts into innovating new specific high-tech materials."** So the focus becomes applying available materials excellently.

Similarly, Cesis's limited economic scale means it can't excel in every area alone—so cooperation becomes the strategy. Constraints force creativity.

### Robust Solutions for Limited Maintenance

Brandt's emphasis on **robust solutions** because "a carpenter might not be able to come by next week" has universal application. As supply chains face more disruptions (climate, geopolitics, pandemics), and as skilled trades face labor shortages, designing for easy maintenance and repair becomes critical everywhere, not just in remote Arctic settlements.

### Data Challenges

Embla Kristjánsdóttir's candor about Greenland's challenge was notable: **"We don't have any data at the moment."** Developing a CO2 action plan requires baseline data that simply doesn't exist yet. This is the reality in many contexts—we need to act before we have perfect information, building data collection into implementation.

### The Economics Speak for Themselves

From Oslo's transformation projects being "one of best practices within real estate development" to Greenland's 50% cost savings on renovation to Riga's ability to fund most work through EU grants rather than municipal budgets—the economic case for circular city development is clear. **"The language of this structure is economy, is numbers,"** as Holthe said. The numbers support circular approaches.

### Reused Products Set to Zero

The Nordic decision to set reused products at zero in LCA calculations (or close to it) creates a powerful incentive structure. While not perfectly accurate (transport and processing have emissions), the policy clearly signals: **keeping materials in use is the priority**.

### From Place to Planet

Holthe's framing—"the life of place, the city life, village life, neighborhood life, is also the life of our planet"—captures the fundamental insight. Place is not separate from planet. What happens in Nuuk, Riga, and Cesis is what happens to Earth. There is no "away" to which waste disappears, no external ecosystem unaffected by local actions.

By focusing on place—concrete, specific, contextual place—we address planetary challenges in the only way that works: through human activity on location, embedded in communities, respecting natural limits, creating value that endures.

## The Path Forward

As the session concluded, Anne Mette Christiansen provided a synthesis that honored the diverse contributions while identifying common threads. She highlighted:

**Refurbishment over demolition**: The social, cultural, economic, and environmental value of not demolishing but rather refurbishing and renovating buildings. "I'm happy to see that we see more and more of that in Greenland as well."

**Repurposing and multi-use**: From the Baltic examples, the inspiration of repurposing buildings and creating multi-use facilities—critical in contexts where buildings are limited.

**Citizen engagement**: The Riga example's importance—ensuring circularity "is not just something that happens in a government building or in the construction sector, but that we make sure that people also really understand why is this important." Measuring progress, inspiring citizens and businesses, creating business opportunities around the circular agenda.

**Circular procurement**: The inclusion of circular criteria in public tenders as essential leverage.

**Greenlandic context insights**: From Brandt's presentation, the need for robust solutions when maintenance access is limited, and the opportunity to reconnect to traditional practices like design for disassembly.

Christiansen concluded: "I think that's a nice thread to all of the presentations. And very good to see the strategy presented as well. I think it's a great piece of work."

### From Theory to Practice, From Vision to Action

The session demonstrated movement from Holthe's place economy theory through multiple practical implementations. Riga shows how a capital city operationalizes circular principles across eight thematic areas with three work directions. Cesis shows how rural regions create voluntary agreements that mainstream circularity into funding mechanisms. Greenland shows how Arctic contexts demand and demonstrate approaches that combine traditional wisdom with contemporary systems.

The Nordic collaboration shows how countries can harmonize regulations while respecting national differences. The focus on existing building stock, LCA calculations, and circular procurement creates the policy infrastructure for transformation.

### The 2030 Deadline

Helle Redder Momsen's statement hangs in the air: "Within five years, the Nordic countries have this vision of being the most sustainable and integrated region in the world."

Five years is not long. Achieving that vision requires accelerating everything discussed in this session:

- Retrofit-first as default, not exception
- Circular procurement as standard practice
- LCA calculations embedded in all construction
- Reused products incentivized through regulations
- Nordic-Baltic collaboration on material flows
- Urban-rural knowledge symbiosis
- Trust-based community agreements
- Traditional knowledge honored alongside innovation
- Place-based approaches scaled across regions

The tools exist. The examples exist. The economic case exists. The political will exists. The question is execution—and that depends on the foundation this session emphasized above all others: **trust**.

### Einar Kleppe Holthe's Closing

"Thank you. That's an excellent summary. Thank you so much. And I think that will be the concluding speech of this session. Thank you so much for participating to everyone. And now take a small break before the closing session of the full day. Thank you so much to all contributors."

## Conclusion: Place as Practice

Session 5 succeeded in moving circular cities and regions from abstraction to practice. By grounding the discussion in specific places—Riga, Cesis, Oslo, Nuuk, Disko Bay—and specific projects—urban resource centers, bioregion memorandums, DGNB systems, housing block renovations—the session made circular economy tangible.

Three overarching insights emerge:

**First**, circular cities require economic thinking that integrates nature, human, societal, and market values. "The language of this structure is economy, is numbers"—but the numbers must describe values beyond capital. When renovation costs half of new construction while preserving social and environmental value, the case is clear. When organic food procurement reduces emissions while improving child nutrition and supporting local farmers, the integration of values makes economic sense.

**Second**, place-based approaches don't mean isolated local action. Rather, they mean understanding local context deeply enough to connect it effectively to regional, national, and global systems. Riga's EU mission label connects the city to 99 other climate-neutral cities. Cesis's bioregion integrates with LEADER funding. Greenland's DGNB system adapts international standards. The Nordic LCA collaboration harmonizes national regulations. Local and global are not opposites but complementary scales of action.

**Third**, trust and culture determine success or failure. Greenland's strategy works without mandatory legislation because community trust enables agreement. Cesis's memorandum of goodwill succeeds because 13 institutions chose to align around shared values. Oslo's transformations work because clients trust circular approaches deliver economic and social value. Riga's citizen engagement matters because urban residents have forgotten circular practices that cultural memory retains. **"If you don't have trust, you don't manage to create any good place."**

The session title asked how cities and regions become circular. The answer: not through mandates alone, but through **place economy thinking + practical implementation + community trust + cultural respect + economic viability + knowledge sharing + robust design + circular procurement + adaptive reuse + traditional wisdom + contemporary innovation**.

From place to planet, one project at a time, one building at a time, one community at a time, one memorandum at a time, one procurement at a time—this is how circular cities are built.

Not by inventing something entirely new, but by reconnecting what industrialization severed: knowledge and materials and community, place and planet, economics and ecology, tradition and innovation, local and global, human and nature.

As the Nordic countries race toward their 2030 vision of being the most sustainable and integrated region in the world, this session charted the path. The destination is clear. The methods are proven. The barriers are surmountable.

The question is not whether circular cities are possible. Riga, Cesis, and countless projects across the Arctic, Nordic, and Baltic regions prove they are.

The question is whether we have the courage to trust each other, the humility to listen, and the commitment to act on what we already know.
