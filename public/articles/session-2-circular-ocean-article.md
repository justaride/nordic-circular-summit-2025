# From Waste to Value: Nordic Ocean Industries Lead Circular Revolution

**Nordic Circular Summit 2025 deep-dives into seafood transformation**

*November 19, 2025 | Nuuk, Greenland*

---

In a packed session at the Nordic Circular Summit 2025, ocean industry leaders from across the Nordic and Arctic region gathered in Nuuk to share breakthrough examples of how circular economy principles are transforming one of the region's most important economic sectors: fisheries and ocean industries.

The "Circular Ocean Industries" panel brought together corporate giants, innovative startups, and the enabling clusters that connect them—all united by a common goal: to eliminate the staggering 23 million metric tons of edible seafood currently lost or wasted globally each year.

## The 100% Philosophy: Iceland's Gift to the World

Alexandra Leeper, CEO of Iceland Ocean Cluster, joined remotely from Reykjavik to share the organization's flagship "100% Fish" philosophy—a concept that has transformed how the industry thinks about seafood utilization.

"We lose and waste more than 23 million metric tons of edible quality aquatic food annually," Leeper explained. "This is not only environmentally impactful, but economically wasteful."

Iceland's journey provides a powerful model. Historically, the country used only about 45% of each fish's biomass—primarily the fillets. Through tight collaborations between entrepreneurs, researchers, and industry, that number has risen to over 90%.

"Heads, skins, bones, guts, blood—everything is now used to create valuable products, from food to textiles, cosmetics, biotechnology, and even biomedical applications," Leeper said.

The economic impact is staggering: Atlantic cod, once worth about $12 USD per fish, now has a potential value of around $5,000 USD when fully utilized.

### The Secret Sauce: Can It Transfer?

But can Iceland's success transfer to other contexts?

"We don't need to reinvent the wheels," Leeper emphasized. "Many of those core steps are practically applicable to many other places."

The methodology is location-agnostic:
1. Know what species you're landing and in what volumes
2. Understand current processing methods
3. Identify nutritional and functional properties of side streams
4. Assess market opportunities and prototype developments
5. Build business cases

Iceland Ocean Cluster's sister network now spans 12 countries, including the Danish Ocean Cluster represented in Nuuk. Each adapts the 100% philosophy to their local context while sharing learnings across the network.

## Royal Greenland: Corporate Transformation from Loss to Profit

If Iceland provides the philosophy, Royal Greenland demonstrates corporate execution at scale.

Kristian S. Ottesen, heading process optimization and resource utilization at Royal Greenland, shared a transformation story that resonated deeply with the Nuuk audience.

Royal Greenland is massive: 100% owned by Greenland's 56,000 citizens, employing 2,400 people globally (1,200 in Greenland), with turnover equivalent to 35% of Greenland's entire GDP. They are the world's largest cold-water shrimp producer.

But size doesn't automatically equal circular success.

### The Ilulissat Challenge

At Royal Greenland's shrimp factory in Ilulissat, 12-15,000 tons of raw shrimp arrive annually. With only 34-44% utilization, that means 7,000-10,000 tons of biomass—shrimp shells and heads—were historically discarded.

The factory couldn't just dump this into Disco Bay. Ice flows would destroy any outflow pipes within weeks. So they built a shrimp meal factory to process the waste.

There was just one problem: it lost 800,000 Danish kroner every single year.

"That doesn't really foster incentive to run the factory," Ottesen understated.

### The Turnaround: Two Paths to Profitability

The team faced a choice: reduce operating costs or increase product value. "We looked at each other and said, why not do both?"

Through the 100% Shrimp project—funded by Nordic Innovation and partnering with Iceland Ocean Cluster, Primex Iceland, Stakau Denmark, Nord Fima Norway, and Nordic Marine Nutrition—they transformed the operation.

Key changes:
- Shifted from low-value shrimp meal to high-value chitosan
- Partnered with Primex Iceland, which produces chitosan for retail products
- Optimized processing to reduce costs
- **Most critically: embedded the project in organizational culture**

"We made all the mistakes you can do in a project like this," Ottesen admitted. "We didn't involve the right departments at the right time."

The lesson? Circular economy transformation requires cultural change, not just technical fixes.

"It's very important that the factories and people who work with this daily take ownership," he emphasized. "You can't just push projects over people's heads from the main office."

Royal Greenland's success came from leveraging Greenlandic culture, where using everything from a catch is naturally ingrained. "We have a cultural way of using everything," Ottesen noted, echoing traditional knowledge shared by Minister Peter Borg in the opening session.

The result: a loss-making operation transformed into a profit center, demonstrating that circular business models can be financially viable even in challenging Arctic logistics environments.

## Hylia Nordic: The Startup Disrupting Side Stream Stigma

While Royal Greenland represents corporate transformation, Michaela Lindström's journey with Hylia Nordic shows how startups can disrupt industry norms.

"As a startup and as a founder, we've done so many mistakes," Lindström opened candidly. "But we are on a learning journey—we listen, we learn, and we adapt."

Hylia's mission started with a simple question: "Why is so much seafood being wasted?"

Initially focused on Baltic herring in Finland, they quickly realized this wasn't a local problem—it's global.

### The Processing Problem

Fifteen percent of global seafood is wasted at the processing stage. Depending on species, 30-70% becomes low-value products (fish meal, fish oil) or even landfill waste that companies pay to discard.

Meanwhile, global seafood demand is predicted to nearly double by 2050.

"We need a sustainable solution," Lindström stated. "If so much is being lost, we already have the future demand in our hands. We just need to utilize it smarter."

### The Taste Test: Why Circular Food Must Be Delicious

Having worked with plant-based proteins previously, Lindström learned a crucial lesson: sustainability alone doesn't sell food products.

"It doesn't matter how good an idea it is. For consumers, in addition to price, it needs to taste good and have good texture and mouthfeel."

This insight drives Hylia's technology, which transforms side streams into products that "taste and feel like familiar seafood."

But there's another challenge: changing processor mindsets.

"Seafood processors today are used to selling premium products," she explained. "The fresher the filet, the better. But if we want people to eat side streams, we need products that resemble familiar seafood."

### Side Streams: The Hidden Superfood

Nutritionally, side streams often surpass fillets:
- 20x more calcium
- 10x more zinc
- 5x more collagen
- 2x more iron

"Imagine if you would just eat collagen in your food instead of buying expensive pills," Lindström suggested.

Hylia's technology enables seafood processors to create new product lines in different price ranges, competing not just within seafood but against other proteins like chicken.

The proof: Eight products now on Finnish retail shelves (chilled, frozen, ready meals, canned goods), recognition from UN UNIDO Global Call, and Best Business Food Tech Award.

"What we decide to do with side streams really does matter," Lindström concluded. "We can make a change. The best and most important thing is to have more food from each fish we catch."

## The Enablers: Ocean Clusters as Connectors

If Iceland, Royal Greenland, and Hylia represent the frontline innovations, ocean clusters provide the critical infrastructure enabling them.

### Danish Ocean Cluster: Logistics as Leverage

Linn Indrestrand from Danish Ocean Cluster, based in Hirtshals port, brought a different lens: logistics and transport.

"The solutions to many challenges in green transition and circular economy start with logistics and transport," she stated. "It's all about volumes."

The logic is simple but powerful: To use 100% of fish—including bones, skin, and guts—you need critical mass. Every time materials move, quality degrades. Quality degradation means price degradation.

"We, as a port, had tons of volume coming through, going to different markets," Indrestrand explained. "We had to look at this as a big puzzle, and we are just this tiny piece."

Danish Ocean Cluster connects companies across the value chain:
- Energy companies
- Transport and logistics
- Fishing companies
- Technology providers

Example: An X-ray company that finds bones pairs with a company that wants bones for collagen extraction. Danish Ocean Cluster facilitates the collaboration across Europe.

"Ports' role is changing," she observed. "Right now, we see ports as industry developers—not wanting to own everything, but enabling and sharing information."

The cluster brings companies together with ongoing business plans and cases, not just networking for its own sake.

### ACT Cluster: Trust and Cross-Sectoral Innovation

Monika Poulsen, cluster manager for the Arctic Cluster Team (ACT) in Northern Norway, emphasized the cultural foundation enabling circular transitions.

With 119 partners across process industry, mining, energy, seafood, and manufacturing, ACT represents eight years of trust-building.

"The culture of the cluster—being very inclusive, open, interested, looking for partners—is very important for succeeding," Poulsen explained.

Her key insight: "Solutions lie between sectors, not within sectors."

Example: Finnfjord metal producer partnered with University of Tromsø to use carbon for growing Arctic algae for fish farming—creating entirely new value chains.

But cross-sectoral innovation takes time.

"Companies start by looking within their own walls for solutions, then to competitors," Poulsen noted. "Our role is connecting companies across sectors to find resources and ideas."

ACT's approach: scouting and building partnerships across the Arctic and Europe, bringing potential collaborators to companies that don't have time for six-day trips to Nuuk.

"I will bring home potential collaborating partners for them to realize their next innovation projects," she said. "That's our role."

### The Cluster Ecosystem: Scale Through Connection

All three cluster representatives echoed similar themes:

**Trust takes time but enables everything else.**
"Building up trust takes time," Indrestrand said. "Once we get that trust, we have to make the cause bigger than any person."

**Connections matter more than ownership.**
"If you stop sharing, you're putting a glass bulb over yourself—the beginning of dying out," Indrestrand warned. "We have to pop the lids and work together."

**The right people in the right chairs.**
"I've had so many good ideas die because the wrong person was in the wrong chair," Indrestrand noted. "People deal with people."

Kristian Ottesen validated their role: "Clusters create connections and map the dots. Iceland Ocean Cluster said, 'Here are some collaborative partners you should meet.' That's how 100% Shrimp developed."

## Collaboration Pays: The Business Case for Partnership

Cathrine Barth, moderating the discussion, pushed on a critical question: "How much does it actually pay to collaborate? Not how much does it cost?"

The answers revealed circular economy's hidden value propositions.

### For Royal Greenland

Logistics is the major cost in Greenland's dispersed geography—37 production sites along the west coast, one on the east.

"Creating critical mass is a big problem," Ottesen explained. "It's still low-margin products working with side streams. Logistics is something we really have to work on."

Clusters help by connecting Royal Greenland with logistics companies to create attractive systems. More importantly, they identify partners along the value chain—from small startups to medium companies to massive industrial partners—each solving specific tasks.

The result: A transformed operation that enhances reputation, creates strategic value, and contributes to Greenland's self-sufficiency goals.

### For the Clusters

Monika Poulsen emphasized the long-term investment perspective.

"Our core business is development and innovation. Companies' core business is running companies," she said. "Scouting and building partnerships around Europe and the Arctic takes time."

Clusters provide the arena for companies to meet potential partners, with funding schemes supporting long-term partnership building.

"Norway's new Arctic strategy points to the importance of partnerships across the Arctic," she noted. "But how do we build them? Clusters are a great tool for connecting industries across sectors and geographies."

The ROI isn't just financial—it's network effects, knowledge sharing, and accelerated innovation timelines.

## Arctic Advantages: Turning Remoteness into Resilience

Throughout the session, participants reframed Arctic "challenges" as advantages.

**Logistics constraints force innovation.**
When you can't just dump waste in the ocean (literally impossible in Ilulissat's iceflows), you must innovate. Constraints breed creativity.

**Traditional knowledge provides blueprints.**
Greenlandic culture's principle of using every part of a catch isn't quaint tradition—it's ancient circular economy. As Ottesen noted, this cultural foundation makes circular projects easier to embed organizationally.

**Trust infrastructure matters more than physical infrastructure.**
In Session 1, Edvard Mørk stated, "The real infrastructure in Greenland is trust." The ocean industries panel validated this repeatedly: trust enables everything else.

**Small scale enables adaptability.**
Rather than competing on scale, Nordic-Arctic industries can compete on adaptability. Different contexts, different solutions—connected through cluster networks.

## The Panel's Pride: What Success Looks Like

Cathrine Barth concluded by asking each participant what they're most proud of.

**Kristian Ottesen (Royal Greenland):**
"Creating this momentum of resource utilization—having a department focusing on that. It's quite rare in the industry to set it up as a focal point and part of our overall strategy. That's something we're really proud of."

**Monika Poulsen (ACT Cluster):**
"The culture we built that always welcomes new resources, ideas, and partners. We've come a long way taking ideas to realized solutions. Working across industries—process, mining, energy, seafood, manufacturing—I don't see many clusters like that."

**Linn Indrestrand (Danish Ocean Cluster):**
"We've often been the bigger person—playing politicians and companies well to get them to join. We take our ego aside and get the job done. New collaborations, gaining bridges not burning them. I'm proud of that."

## Closing: From Local to Global, From Waste to Superfood

Alexandra Leeper, joining from Reykjavik throughout the session, offered final reflections on what she'd heard.

"Wonderful to hear these messages around trust, relationship building, connecting people in the right way, and how action-driven everyone was," she said. "Bringing people together so good ideas can happen—tangible examples. I agree with everything everyone said."

Her advice for connecting remote regions?

"Talk to people. Find people in your team that love to travel and are keen to talk to people from very different contexts. Share ideas back," she suggested.

"You don't have to meet everyone all the time everywhere all at once. Find those connecting pieces that have ripple effects and know their ecosystem."

Through Iceland Ocean Cluster's sister network and their establishing Blue Nova Ventures program, they're operationalizing this philosophy—with Linn Indrestrand serving as Danish scout for the program.

## Key Takeaways

The Circular Ocean Industries session demonstrated that circular economy in Nordic ocean industries is moving from philosophy to practice:

1. **100% utilization is achievable** - Iceland proves it, Royal Greenland scales it, startups like Hylia democratize it

2. **Side streams are opportunity, not waste** - Nutritionally superior, economically valuable when properly utilized

3. **Corporate transformation requires culture change** - Technical solutions fail without organizational buy-in

4. **Clusters enable at scale** - Connecting people, scouting partners, building trust over time

5. **Logistics determines viability** - Transport and volumes critical for circular business models

6. **Cross-sectoral solutions beat single-sector thinking** - Innovation lies between industries

7. **Arctic constraints breed innovation** - Remoteness, ice, geography force creative solutions

8. **Trust infrastructure matters most** - Physical infrastructure follows social infrastructure

9. **Traditional knowledge informs modern practice** - Indigenous principles of using everything align with circular economy

10. **Nordic collaboration scales** - Sister clusters, shared projects, knowledge transfer across borders

As the session concluded with applause in Nuuk and viewers joining from multiple continents, one thing became clear: the future of ocean industries isn't about catching more fish—it's about creating more value from every fish already caught.

From waste to value. From 45% to 90%+. From $12 to $5,000.

That's the circular ocean revolution unfolding across Nordic and Arctic waters.
