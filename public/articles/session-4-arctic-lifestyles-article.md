# Circularity as Tradition: How Greenlandic Wisdom Can Transform Modern Product Systems

**Nordic Circular Summit 2025 - Session 4 Analysis**
**November 19, 2025 | Nuuk, Greenland**

---

## Executive Summary

"In Greenland, circularity isn't a trend, it's a tradition and it's the foundation." With this simple but profound statement, Frederik Thrane of Denmark's Lifestyle and Design Cluster opened Session 4 of the Nordic Circular Summit 2025, setting the stage for one of the conference's most culturally resonant and practically instructive conversations.

In a 60-minute session that moved seamlessly from apparel to seafood, from local craft production to Digital Product Passports, from Greenlandic villages to Swedish textile factories, participants explored a question that should humble anyone working in circular economy: **What if we don't need to invent circularity—what if we just need to listen to those who never abandoned it?**

The session brought together remarkable contrasts: Mia Chemnitz, a 30-year-old Greenlandic entrepreneur transforming musk ox wool and sealskin in a store where she "can tell you who made" every product, and Kristian Ottesen, a Danish director at Royal Greenland, a 300-year-old state-owned seafood company, now reintroducing the circular practices it had abandoned during industrialization. Gisle Mariani Mardal from Norway's NFTA explained how Digital Product Passports can turn compliance into competitive advantage, while Tilda Larsson from Sweden's 137-year-old Ludwig Svensson described how local manufacturing makes DPP implementation "very easy and very quick."

Co-moderated by Lise Lotte, born in Qaanaaq—Greenland's northernmost village—the session revealed how **quota limitations become sustainability drivers**, how **the maker is the best repairer**, how **waste is the starting point** ("we hunt for the meat, and then we wear the rest"), and how a scarf is "not just a scarf" but **"a piece of history, culture, tradition—and a meal."**

Perhaps most powerfully, the session illuminated fundamental cultural differences: Nordic societies' individualism versus Greenlandic collectivism, and the imperative to **"listen while we share"** because **"we have two ears and one mouth."**

For global businesses struggling to implement circular principles, this session offered something more valuable than best practices—it offered ancient wisdom that has sustained Arctic communities for millennia, now ready to be encoded into QR codes and scaled across continents.

## Part 1: Setting the Foundation - Circularity as Cultural DNA

### The Framing: Beyond Output, Toward Resilience

Frederik Thrane's opening framing was deliberately philosophical. "Across the Arctic and the Nordic, design and production have traditionally been about more than output," he began. "They're acts of resiliency, self-sufficiency, and cultural continuity."

This distinction matters profoundly. In the linear economy, production is measured by volume, efficiency, and cost per unit. The goal is output. But in traditional Arctic societies, production has always been about something deeper: **ensuring survival, maintaining culture, and strengthening community bonds**.

When a Greenlandic hunter harvests a seal, the act encompasses:
- **Sustenance**: Meat for the family and community
- **Materials**: Skin for clothing that enables survival in Arctic conditions
- **Economy**: Trade and exchange within the community
- **Culture**: Maintaining traditional skills and knowledge
- **Spirituality**: Respect for the animal and the land

This is circular economy in its most integrated form—not as a business strategy, but as a way of life.

### "Nothing Goes to Waste and Everything Has Purpose"

Thrane continued: "In Greenland, the mindset spans from the use of musk ox wool and seal skin to the valorization of seafood side streams. **Nothing goes to waste and everything has purpose.**"

This principle—that nothing is waste, only resources not yet utilized—is the foundational insight of circular economy. But in Greenland, it has never been a principle that needed articulating. It's simply how life works.

The session's central question emerged: **"What can companies, from fashion to food, learn about design systems that waste nothing and strengthen communities?"**

This question inverts the typical knowledge transfer. Instead of experts teaching Arctic communities about circular economy, what if Arctic communities have been the experts all along?

## Part 2: Lise Lotte's Arctic Perspective - Resilience as Necessity

### Born in Qaanaaq: Where Waste is Not an Option

Lise Lotte, co-moderator and independent consultant, brought immediate grounding to the session's themes. "My name is Lise Lotte and I was born and raised up in Qaanaaq in North Greenland," she began.

Qaanaaq is Greenland's northernmost village, one of the most remote inhabited places on Earth. When Lise Lotte describes growing up there, she's describing a place where the circular imperative is not philosophical but existential.

**"Growing up in a remote Arctic community has shaped my understanding of what resilience truly means,"** she explained. **"In our everyday life every resource has value, nothing is wasted, but not because it was a trend but because it was a necessity deeply rooted in Inuit tradition."**

This distinction—necessity versus trend—cuts to the heart of circular economy's challenge in industrialized societies. The Nordics and Europe are trying to re-learn circular principles as a response to climate change, resource scarcity, and supply chain vulnerability. But for Arctic communities, these principles never left.

### Place-Based Knowledge in Policy

Lise Lotte spent nine years with the Government of Greenland, working on political processes and Arctic decision-making. She now runs her own company, working with stakeholders "in Greenland, the Nordic and EU, and across the Arctic, to highlight the importance of **place-based knowledge**."

This term—place-based knowledge—is crucial. It stands in contrast to universal principles, best practices, and scalable solutions. Place-based knowledge emerges from specific ecosystems, specific climates, specific cultures. It cannot be easily transferred or codified. It must be learned in context.

**"What I bring to today's session is an understanding of how local practices reflect a broader Arctic mindset, a mindset where design, production, and community are inseparable,"** Lise Lotte said.

That inseparability—design-production-community as an integrated whole—is what circular economy seeks to restore. But in trying to codify it into systems, metrics, and regulations, are we losing the very essence that makes it work?

## Part 3: Grevilliot - The Story of a Scarf

### From Mountain to Garment: Complete Local Production

When Frederik Thrane asked Mia Chemnitz where his scarf started, her answer was beautifully straightforward: "It was a wild animal on the mountains near Kangerlussuaq. Then a hunter went out, shot the animal, sold the meat, and then I bought the hide."

This answer contains worlds:
- **Hunter-based economy**: The raw materials come from local hunters, sustaining traditional livelihoods
- **Dual-purpose harvest**: The animal is hunted for meat; the hide is a byproduct that becomes a premium material
- **Complete traceability**: Mia knows exactly where every material comes from
- **Zero waste**: What the linear economy would call "waste" is the foundation of Grevilliot's business

From there, the process continues: "We take the wool off the hide. And then there's a process that is the only part that kind of leaves our hands. Because we don't have a spinning facility in Greenland, we have to ship it out of the country to spin it. But then it comes back as yarn. This one is knitted by us. Sometimes we dye it, and then we sell it."

**"So every single material that we use is from a hunter that is local."**

This is local value chain at its purest. Except for one step—spinning—the entire production happens within Greenland, within Mia's direct knowledge and control.

### The Power of Quota Limitations

When Frederik jokingly asked if he could order 100,000 scarves, Mia's response was immediate and illuminating: "No, and there is no discount for big amounts."

Why? **"We are always limited by quotas."**

This is one of the session's most counterintuitive insights. In conventional business thinking, scale is everything. Economies of scale reduce costs. Volume increases profitability. Growth is the goal.

But for Grevilliot, **quota limitations are not a problem to be solved—they're a sustainability feature to be embraced**.

"With the musk ox wool, there is nowhere else in the world where I can go out and buy more raw material," Mia explained. "We have to buy all the hides to be able to take the wool off during a two-month period in the coldest part of the winter. Otherwise, there is no raw material. There is no production."

**"We are sold out all the time,"** she admitted. "Which it's a luxury problem. I know that."

This creates a fundamentally different business model:
- **Scarcity-driven value**: Limited supply makes products precious, not cheap
- **No scaling pressure**: Cannot grow beyond sustainable harvest levels
- **Local value retention**: Could export raw wool to Canada/US, but chooses to keep value in Greenland
- **Intentional pricing**: Don't follow world market prices (which would be much higher), but keep prices accessible to locals

"We try to find a balance where we can live off of our work," Mia said, "but still keeping prices at a level where that is possible for local people."

This is circular economy integrated with social equity—ensuring that the products made from local resources remain accessible to the local community.

### No Impulse Buys, Because Trust and Value Align

Frederik noted that Grevilliot "hardly has any impulse buys" and almost no returns, unlike conventional apparel which has return rates of 30-40%.

Mia's response: **"We do have impulse buyers but they're not local."**

Locals buy Grevilliot products for special occasions—birthdays, celebrations, custom pieces. They buy intentionally, knowing the quality, the maker, and the value. International customers might impulse-buy during a visit to Nuuk, but the core local market is deeply intentional.

This points to one of circular economy's underappreciated challenges: **building trust in quality so that products are purchased intentionally, not impulsively**.

## Part 4: Royal Greenland - Reintroducing What Was Never Forgotten

### Kristian Ottesen's Journey: From Chinese Textiles to Greenlandic Seafood

Kristian Ottesen brought a unique perspective—a Dane who worked in Chinese textiles with ambitions to "change the industry, to make it more sustainable," who then shifted to seaweed cultivation, and now leads waste stream valorization at Royal Greenland.

"I think that kind of life philosophy has followed me all the way through," Kristian reflected. **"Changing systems, working with innovation, improving what we're doing. It has been called a lot of things over the years, but circular mindsets, I guess, is actually coining it quite well."**

This journey matters because it represents someone from outside Greenlandic culture recognizing and learning from the circular wisdom embedded in Greenlandic practices—and then working to reintroduce them into an institution that had lost them.

### "Waste Not, Have Not, Want Not"

Frederik asked how Royal Greenland's work is rooted in Greenlandic culture. Kristian's answer was direct: **"There is this cultural belief and this cultural embeddedness that waste not, have not, want not. So we have the tradition, or there is the tradition, of utilizing everything. And that makes it quite easy to get these things across."**

This cultural embeddedness is what makes Greenland's circular practices so powerful—and so hard to replicate elsewhere. In societies where waste disposal is invisible (trash goes "away"), where food comes wrapped in plastic from anonymous supply chains, and where convenience is prioritized over durability, the "waste not" ethic must be consciously re-learned.

In Greenland, it never needed to be learned. It was never lost.

### 38 Outposts: Supply Chains as Community Infrastructure

Royal Greenland operates 38 outposts throughout Greenland. **"In some of the smaller settlements we are the sole supplier or sole employer, so it means everything for the local communities,"** Kristian explained.

Sometimes it's only "three people and a freezer," but those three people and that freezer connect a settlement of perhaps 200 people to global seafood markets. **"Even the smallest settlements in Greenland have actually a global market reach in a way. So it's kind of beautiful."**

This is the locally-rooted-globally-connected model in practice. Small communities maintain their way of life, their connection to place, and their cultural practices—while participating in global markets on terms that work for them.

### Reintroducing Practices Lost to Industrialization

Perhaps the most poignant moment came when Frederik asked Kristian about "reintroducing the practices that Royal Greenland was founded on but that has been abandoned for a long period of time."

Kristian acknowledged the paradox: **"This has been done for centuries before we or I came along, but now we are reintroducing it. Because I think along with the industrialization of the fishing industry, we've forgotten some of these things."**

He recalled a comment from earlier in the day: **"We don't have to reinvent the wheel. We have to listen and learn from the history and then just reinstate some of the practices."**

This is one of the circular economy's uncomfortable truths. The "innovations" we celebrate—waste valorization, resource efficiency, local production networks—are often just re-learning what traditional societies never forgot.

## Part 5: The Maker is the Best Repairer

### Repair as Natural Extension of Making

When asked about repair practices, Mia's answer was as simple as it was profound: **"The good thing about buying garments from someone you know is that this person who made the garment is probably the best in the world to repair it. So you just come back and then they fix it."**

This flips the entire paradigm of modern product design. In the linear economy:
1. Designer designs
2. Factory manufactures
3. Consumer purchases
4. Product breaks
5. Repair is unavailable, too expensive, or impossible
6. Product is discarded
7. Repeat

In Grevilliot's model:
1. Maker knows the customer (often personally)
2. Maker creates the product
3. Customer uses the product (often for years)
4. If it needs repair, customer returns to maker
5. Maker repairs (because they know exactly how it was made)
6. Product continues in use
7. Eventually, the materials can be reused or returned to nature

This is what ESPR's "right to repair" tries to codify into regulation. But what regulation must mandate, local relationships make natural.

### "We Hunt for the Meat, and Then We Wear the Rest"

Mia added a crucial point about waste: **"We are basically a company founded on waste product, because we hunt for the meat. And then we wear the rest."**

From a certain perspective, sealskin is a byproduct of meat production—"waste" in conventional terms. But as Mia noted, **"We've never thought of seal skin as a waste product in Greenland. It's very evident, if you look back, that Inuit have survived in the Arctic because of the seal and also because of the seal skin."**

This reframes the entire concept of "side streams" and "waste valorization." These terms imply that the primary product is valuable, and we're finding clever ways to use the waste. But in Greenlandic thinking, **there is no primary product and no waste—only resources with different uses**.

---

## Part 6: Traditional Knowledge vs. Academic Proof

### The Seal Skin Challenge

Frederik raised a fascinating tension: "We're in a world where we measure everything, we love data, we love metrics. But you said that for seal skin there are no such tests."

For outdoor apparel, performance is typically proven through rigorous testing: water pressure resistance, moisture wicking, insulation values, breathability ratings. Every technical fabric comes with a spec sheet.

But seal skin? **"I don't know that there is any tests,"** Mia responded.

Frederik pushed: "However, when it comes to picking an apparel piece for survival, I'd like you to answer that."

Mia's answer: **"I know that I trust the seal skin more than anything that's been tested a lot. So if I'm going on the ice cap or on a dog sled, I know what I'm going to be wearing."**

### Millennia of Testing vs. Laboratory Testing

Frederik synthesized this beautifully: **"I think that ties in beautifully to the prior session with including the locally rooted community, including the locally rooted knowledge, even the knowledge that might not be academically proven yet, but that has a couple of millennia to prove the value of the outcomes."**

This is circular economy's epistemological challenge. The Western industrial model demands:
- Quantifiable metrics
- Laboratory testing
- Peer-reviewed research
- Standardized certifications

But traditional knowledge offers:
- Millennia of lived experience
- Survival as proof of efficacy
- Cultural transmission of expertise
- Place-based adaptation

The question is not whether seal skin performs well—Inuit survival across thousands of years proves it does. The question is whether we can value knowledge systems that don't produce the documentation our systems demand.

## Part 7: Cultural Decolonization Through Materials

### Taking Back Traditional Materials

When Frederik asked if there's been a shift in national appreciation for traditional materials, Mia's answer revealed a profound cultural movement: **"Like 15 years ago, we were all wearing Canada Goose jackets. Like it was the new national suit in Greenland."**

She owns three herself. "But part of what we're trying to do is to **take these amazing materials that we have here on site and make them fashionable again**."

This is not just business strategy—it's cultural reclamation. Mia described it as tapping into "this whole—it's kind of a tricky word in Greenland, probably in Denmark, and maybe where you come from as well—but this **decolonization way of thinking**."

**"So we are taking back our tattoos. We're taking back our earrings. We're taking back our anorak. We're taking back our materials, culture, music, everything."**

### Materials as Decolonization

This reframing is essential. For decades, Indigenous materials and practices were seen as "primitive," "backward," or "unscientific." Industrial materials—synthetics, plastics, mass-manufactured goods—were positioned as superior, modern, progressive.

The result was cultural erasure and ecological destruction. Traditional materials were abandoned, traditional skills were lost, and communities became dependent on imported goods.

Now, as the circular economy movement discovers that traditional materials are:
- More durable
- More repairable
- More sustainable
- More locally sourced
- More culturally meaningful

...Indigenous communities are reclaiming them not as a return to the past, but as a path to a sustainable future.

"We're very lucky with our timing," Mia reflected, "because we're kind of just tagging along there."

## Part 8: What Global Businesses Can Learn

### Kristian's Lesson: If It Works in Greenland, It Works Anywhere

Frederik asked what global businesses can learn from Greenlandic approaches. Kristian's answer focused on constraints as drivers of innovation:

**"Greenland is a massive country, very far from the north to the south, and with no roads attaching any settlement or any townships or anything like that."**

This creates extreme logistical challenges. Collating raw materials to justify production investments is nearly impossible. Competing on commodity pricing is impossible.

**"So it means that if we can make it work here, you know, we have to be a little bit smarter,"** Kristian explained. **"That's where everybody else can learn a little bit from our innovations and our systems and our approaches to working with these value streams."**

His conclusion: **"If we can make it happen here, it's actually with limited resources, then it can also be applied in many other places."**

This is the power of learning from constraint. Greenland's limitations force creativity, efficiency, and circular thinking. Businesses elsewhere may not face the same constraints—but they will soon, as resources tighten, regulations strengthen, and climate change accelerates.

### Mia's Challenge: Start With the Waste

Mia offered a different lesson: **"I kind of want to challenge companies to start with, okay, we have this waste, let's look at it, and what can we do with it?"**

Rather than creating waste minimization strategies after the fact, start with waste as the foundation. "I don't know if that makes any sense," she added uncertainly.

It makes perfect sense. This is Grevilliot's model: the "waste" (sealskin from meat production) is the business foundation. Everything is built from there.

For companies drowning in waste streams they don't know how to handle, this inversion could be transformative. Don't minimize waste as an afterthought—**build your business on the waste**.

---

## Part 9: Digital Product Passport - Encoding Stories

### Gisle Mariani Mardal: The Internet of Things for Products

The session then pivoted to future tools for transparency: the Digital Product Passport. Gisle Mariani Mardal from Norway's NFTA explained:

**"The digital product passport is a way of connecting a physical product to the digital grid. It's the Internet of Things. The easiest way to explain it is a QR code connected to the product."**

Starting in 2026, the DPP will be mandatory for the first product groups in Europe. It will contain:
- Production information
- Working conditions data
- Repair instructions
- Resale connections
- Material composition
- End-of-life handling

### Control Reduces Costs

But why should companies embrace this "burden"? Gisle's answer was economically grounded:

**"Once you have control over the data in your value chain, you know where your product has been, where the fiber has been grown, where it's been produced, how it's been shipped. It's easier to gain control over the product, and it's easier then by having that control to cost cut, because not having control is expensive."**

This inverts the typical framing. Compliance is not a cost—**lack of control is the cost**. DPP reduces that cost.

Additionally, once products are in the market, companies must pay Extended Producer Responsibility fees. "When the product is in the market, it's easy for you to track it, and so it becomes less expensive for you to deal with it," Gisle explained.

### Storytelling Platform

But perhaps most relevant to Grevilliot and Royal Greenland: **"There's a huge opportunity to use it as a communication platform. You can tell the story of the product. The more specific the product is, obviously, the more specific the storytelling becomes."**

Mia had just mentioned that Grevilliot has "a huge potential in tapping into the storytelling, which we never really do, because we're always making stuff."

DPP could be the storytelling platform. The scarf that is "a piece of history, culture, tradition—and a meal" could have that story encoded in a QR code, accessible to every customer.

## Part 10: Tilda Larsson - Local Manufacturing Makes DPP Easy

### 137 Years of Swedish Textile Production

The video interview with Tilda Larsson from AB Ludwig Svensson brought the DPP discussion into concrete practice. Founded in 1887, Ludwig Svensson is "quite unique, I would say, to be a textile company to this day, because **we are still owning and having our own production here in Sweden, and we have the full production line**."

From yarn dyeing to warping, weaving, knitting, finishing, and piece dyeing—everything under one roof.

### The Advantage: "Very Easy and Very Quick"

When asked about DPP implementation challenges, Tilda's answer was striking: **"When I discussed with other companies in the project they told me about their supply chains and how many steps they need to go back in the supply chain to get information. And I was sitting in the same chair, but I was like, that's not the hard part for me, because I can contact all the departments here and I can receive the information very easy and very quick."**

This is the competitive advantage of local manufacturing for DPP compliance. Companies with long, complex, international supply chains will struggle to gather the required data. Companies with everything in-house can access it immediately.

### The Challenge: System Integration

The challenge for Ludwig Svensson is not data availability but **system integration**. "We really need to have a great system for the DPP to be able to collect the data," Tilda explained. The information needs to follow the product through each department and link to customers.

But compared to procuring data from dozens of suppliers across multiple countries? This is a manageable technical challenge.

### "It Should Be Easy to Do Right"

Tilda's closing statement encapsulated the DPP vision: **"I think that it is important that it should not be hard to be sustainable, to make sustainable choices. It should be easy for you to do that, easy to do right."**

This is the promise of DPP: making sustainable choices the default, not the exception.

---

## Part 11: Practical DPP Questions from Mia

### One Scarf vs. 100 Hats

When the conversation returned to the panel, Mia asked the practical question that small producers everywhere will ask: **"Yesterday, I made a scarf. There's only going to be this one scarf. How would that work?"**

Gisle's answer: **"You can individualize it, so you can either do a batch or you could do like per product."** QR codes are easy to generate and print. **"Producing many rather than producing one, I mean, it's the same amount of work."**

This is crucial for artisan and small-batch producers. DPP is not just for mass manufacturing. It can work at any scale.

### How Do You Make Sure It's Not Only the Good Guys?

Mia's second question was even more important: **"How do you make sure that it's not only the good guys doing this?"**

Gisle's answer: **"Everybody has to do it because it becomes compliance. So if you want to put a product on the market in Europe after 2030, then you have to have a digital product passport. So it's basically market access."**

Frederik added: **"It's easier for the good guys to do it than it is for the more opaque supply chains."**

This is the enforcement mechanism. DPP doesn't rely on voluntary adoption—it becomes mandatory for market access. And transparent supply chains will find compliance far easier than opaque ones.

**Compliance becomes a competitive advantage for companies that are already doing the right thing.**

---

## Part 12: Lise Lotte's Synthesis - Knowledge + Materials + Community

### The Core Message

As the session neared its close, Frederik asked Lise Lotte to synthesize the key learnings. Her response was poetic and precise:

**"I think a central message is that today's presentation has been that nothing or less waste is possible when knowledge and materials and community are interconnected."**

This three-part integration—knowledge, materials, community—is the heart of circular economy:
- **Knowledge**: How to work with materials, how to make, how to repair, how to use
- **Materials**: Local, renewable, appropriate to place and purpose
- **Community**: Shared values, reciprocal relationships, collective benefit

When these three are disconnected—as they are in the linear economy—waste becomes inevitable. When they are integrated—as they are in Greenlandic tradition—waste becomes impossible.

### "Maybe It's Just Labeling the Story"

Lise Lotte continued: **"That there are some kind of easy things to do here because we know the story. Maybe it's just a kind of labeling the story."**

This is profound. The stories already exist. The knowledge already exists. The materials already exist. The communities already exist.

DPP and other circular tools are not creating something new—they're making visible what has always been there.

### We Have the Elements

**"It's about that we have the knowledge, we have the traditions, we have the business, we have the society, so we have a lot of the elements,"** Lise Lotte emphasized. **"And that's very nice to hear, thinking of circularity."**

The transition to circular economy is not about inventing something from scratch. It's about reconnecting elements that were separated by industrialization.

---

## Part 13: Collectivism vs. Individualism - The Cultural Divide

### A Fundamental Difference

Perhaps the session's most important insight came near the end, when Frederik asked Lise Lotte about cultural differences between Greenlandic and Nordic societies.

"You mentioned to me in one of our conversations that **one of the key differences between the Greenlandic society and the Nordic society is that the Nordic societies are individualistic and the Greenlandic is collectivistic**," Frederik said.

This distinction is foundational. Circular economy fundamentally requires:
- Sharing resources
- Collaborative consumption
- Collective ownership models
- Knowledge sharing
- Community benefit over individual profit

These are all collectivist values. Individualistic societies struggle with them.

### The Nordics Must Learn to Share

"Maybe that's part of the perspective as it relates to sharing that we, from a Nordic perspective and very much so here today, need to practice even more to be collectivistic, to share more, especially when it comes to knowledge, especially when it comes to enabling, connecting the dots that need to be connected," Frederik reflected.

Lise Lotte agreed: **"That's true, and that's fundamental for the societies in the Nordic and in the Greenlandic, that there are these different ways of dealing with the whole society, and your behavior and so on."**

### Two Ears and One Mouth

Lise Lotte's closing statement was simple but powerful: **"It's also important to say that we do have two ears and one mouth, so I really would like that we listen. While we share, we listen as well."**

This is the essential discipline for circular economy: **listening at least twice as much as speaking**.

The Nordics and Europe have expertise to share—technology, finance, policy frameworks, market access. But Arctic and Indigenous communities have wisdom to share—traditional knowledge, place-based practices, collectivist values, and circular thinking that was never broken.

The transition will only succeed if both sides listen.

---

## Part 14: Nordic-Baltic Collaboration - No One Country Can Solve This

### Kalli Kent's Call for Regional Collaboration

In the closing minutes, Kalli Kent from the Nordic Baltic Textile Transition Group made a brief but important intervention. Representing both Estonia and Denmark, Kalli has spent 20 years building collaboration between the Nordics and the Baltics.

Her message: **"We all know, at least when it comes to textiles, that not one country can figure out the textile circular system."**

The Nordics need upstream and downstream value chain collaboration. And crucially, **"the Baltic countries are receiving lots of used textiles consumed by Nordics. And that requires collaboration."**

This is the material flow reality. Textiles consumed in Norway, Sweden, Denmark, and Finland don't just disappear. Many flow to Baltic countries for reuse, recycling, or (too often) disposal. A truly circular textile system must span the region.

### The Vision: Most Sustainable Region by 2030

"If Nordic countries have a vision to be the most sustainable region by 2030," Kalli argued, "then seen from the textile perspective, they need to collaborate with upstream and downstream value chains."

The Nordic-Baltic Textile Transition Group, supported by the Nordic Council of Ministers, aims to facilitate exactly this collaboration.

---

## Conclusion: The Scarf is Not Just a Scarf

At the end of the session, Lise Lotte made an observation that captured everything discussed: **"Your scarf is not just a scarf. I'm sorry, it's not. It's a bit of a history, a culture, and tradition. And a meal. And a meal. But don't eat it."**

This is what circular economy must become. Not just products, but:
- **History**: Connection to place and tradition
- **Culture**: Expression of community identity
- **Tradition**: Knowledge passed through generations
- **Sustenance**: Dual-purpose resources (meat + material)

When a product embodies all of this, it cannot be thrown away. It has too much meaning.

### From Wasteful to Waste-less, From Volatile to Resilient

Frederik's opening framing promised to examine "pathways that move us from wasteful to waste-less, from volatile to resilient."

The session delivered. Grevilliot and Royal Greenland demonstrated waste-less systems built on cultural continuity and ecological constraint. Ludwig Svensson showed how local manufacturing creates resilience through data control and supply chain visibility. The Digital Product Passport offers a tool to make stories and data accessible at scale.

But perhaps most importantly, the session demonstrated that the transition from wasteful to waste-less is not a technical challenge or a policy challenge—it's a cultural challenge.

### The Questions Moving Forward

The session leaves us with essential questions:

1. **Can individualistic societies learn collectivist values?** Or will circular economy remain constrained by cultural resistance to sharing?

2. **Can we value traditional knowledge?** Or will our demand for academic proof prevent us from learning from millennia of lived experience?

3. **Can quota limitations become design features?** Or will we continue to see scarcity as a problem to be solved through growth?

4. **Can we build businesses on waste?** Or will we continue to create products first and manage waste afterward?

5. **Can compliance become competitive advantage?** Or will businesses resist transparency until forced?

6. **Can the Nordics truly listen?** Or will they continue to speak more than they hear?

### The Ultimate Lesson

The ultimate lesson from Session 4 is humility. For all our technological sophistication, policy frameworks, and market mechanisms, Arctic communities have been practicing circular economy for millennia.

As Kristian said: **"We don't have to reinvent the wheel. We have to listen and learn from the history and then just reinstate some of the practices."**

The question is not whether circular economy is possible. Grevilliot and Royal Greenland prove it is. The question is whether we can set aside our assumptions about progress, modernity, and expertise long enough to learn from those who never abandoned circularity in the first place.

In Greenland, circularity isn't a trend. It's a tradition. And it's the foundation.

Perhaps it always should have been.
