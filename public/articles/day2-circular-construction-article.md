# From Pilots to Practice: Nordic Circular Construction's Pivotal Moment

**Digital partner session reveals path from experimentation to systemic transformation**

*November 20, 2025 | Digital Partner Session, Nordic Circular Summit 2025*

---

The gap between Nordic ambitions and circular construction reality was laid bare in this pivotal Day 2 session. While the Nordic region aspires to be the world's most sustainable and integrated region by 2030, its circularity in construction remains among the lowest globally. Three experts from Norway, Iceland, and Denmark charted the way forward.

## The Uncomfortable Truth About Nordic Construction

Jan Thomas Odegard of Natural State and Nordic Circular Construction opened with a frank assessment: despite ambitious sustainability goals, the Nordics face eight major challenges blocking circular construction:

1. **Linear domination** - virgin materials remain cheaper than recycled alternatives
2. **Policy limitations** favoring linear business with no reuse requirements
3. **Public procurement** with intentions but no action at scale
4. **Immature, fragmented markets** with weak value chains
5. **Trust issues** with circular products and competence gaps
6. **Low risk appetite** across the sector
7. **Small reuse markets** with timing mismatches
8. **Slow construction cycles** limiting experimentation

"If we are to reach our sustainability goals, we really have to do changes in the way we do construction," Odegard emphasized, citing sobering targets: Denmark must reduce new construction by 80% by 2030, while Norway needs a 72% reduction in material use.

## Nordic Maturity: An Honest Ranking

In a rare moment of regional self-assessment, Odegard mapped Nordic countries against the circular construction pioneer:

| Maturity Level | Countries |
|----------------|-----------|
| **Pioneer (benchmark)** | Netherlands |
| **Leading** | Denmark, Finland |
| **Following** | Sweden |
| **Catching up** | Norway, Iceland |
| **Starting journey** | Greenland |

"One of the ideas of this seminar is that if we move together, learn from each other, then we can move faster," Odegard explained. The session demonstrated exactly this cross-border knowledge sharing.

## The Building Less Revolution

Perhaps the most provocative insight: the most sustainable building is often no new building at all. The **Building Stop Movement** in Denmark and Europe's **Sufficiency Movement** are evolving from advocacy into law.

Denmark's "bevare eller forklare" (preserve or explain) principle is becoming regulation, requiring justification before demolition. Finland's new building law contains similar elements.

The potential is staggering:
- **200,000+ unused buildings** in Norwegian districts alone
- Taking just 10% of large houses (where 1-2 people live) and splitting them could yield **130,000 units** in both Norway and Denmark
- This equals Norway's entire 5-year housing construction target—from *existing* buildings

"Helsinki has loads of office space abandoned during COVID. Now they're trying to take that into housing space," Odegard noted, showing that adaptive reuse isn't just theory.

## Iceland's 900-Year Material Heritage

Anna Karlsdottir of Ludica Architects delivered a powerful perspective from Iceland—a nation where approximately 80% of buildings are concrete, yet which built biodegradable structures for nearly 900 years.

"For nearly 900 years we built structures that were biodegradable, required constant care, and returned to the earth when they were no longer in use," Karlsdottir explained. "In contrast, our modern material systems are permanent, resource-intensive, and environmentally burdensome."

Iceland's challenges are distinct:
- Small population and fragmented markets
- Island isolation with import dependence
- Harsh climate, earthquakes, and volcanic activity
- Significant information gaps

Yet these constraints spark innovation. The **Kjeldur farmhouse**, dating to the 12th century, still stands—proof that local, circular building is possible.

## The Hempcrete Breakthrough

Karlsdottir's **Hamkrid project**—Iceland's first hempcrete building—embodied both the promise and frustration of circular construction innovation.

The project parameters were intentionally circular:
- Use local and natural building materials
- Minimize ground intervention
- Design for disassembly and reuse
- Share knowledge openly

The first obstacle? Regulation. Without CE marking, standard permits were impossible. "We found a workaround—to keep the structure under 15 m² and 2.5 m in height," Karlsdottir revealed. "**Innovation literally operated within a loophole.**"

The paradox became sharper: the project was later criticized for being too small to provide useful monitoring data—the very limitation imposed by regulations.

## Future Matters: Reclaiming Lost Knowledge

From the Hamkrid project emerged **Future Matters**, a collaborative research initiative exploring Iceland's architectural heritage and possible futures.

Key discoveries revealed patterns of both challenge and opportunity:

**Lost:**
- Research infrastructure (Iceland's building research institute was closed)
- Local manufacturing capacity
- Forgotten material techniques (pumice blocks, scoria construction, rammed earth)

**Remaining:**
- Rich material heritage
- Regenerative possibilities
- Opportunity to shift value creation to local contexts

"If concrete brought Iceland to modernity, what brings us into a regenerative future?" Karlsdottir asked—a question relevant across the Nordics.

## Nordic Government Collaboration: The Policy Framework

Helle Redder Momsen from the Danish Authority of Social Services and Housing represented the **Nordic Sustainable Construction Collaboration**—government authorities from all Nordic countries working together on green, digital, and circular transition.

The 2023 Nordic Ministers' Declaration recognized "the potential in preserving and developing the existing building stock as a contribution to reduced emissions." This principle now drives a collaboration running through 2027.

### The Building Hierarchy Triangle

Drawing from Finland's 2022 Architecture Policy, Momsen presented a simple framework:

1. **First**: Use what already exists for its intended purpose
2. **Then**: Prolong lifetime with maintenance and care
3. **If not possible**: Renovate, change use, and transform
4. **If more space needed**: Extend the existing
5. **Only then**: Build new (preferably with reused materials)

As the earlier **Beyond Zero** collaboration stated: **"The most sustainable building is the one that is kept in use and loved."**

## Nine Policy Measures for Circular Transformation

The Nordic Climate Forum for Construction identified priority measures:

1. **Lifetime extension** - key driver for impact
2. **Demolition prevention** - criteria before taking down buildings
3. **Remove barriers** - easier renovation processes
4. **Multi-use** - efficient utilization of existing square meters
5. **Incentives** - tax instruments supporting circularity
6. **Design optimization** - better initial design
7. **Design for disassembly** - future reuse built in
8. **Procurement power** - public sector driving demand
9. **Research and piloting** - demonstration projects

On reused materials in lifecycle assessments, most Nordic countries now assign **zero emissions value** to reused products—not because the impact is zero, but to motivate market development.

## The Circular Construction Product Catalog

Perhaps the most actionable output: Nordic Circular Construction's **Product Catalog** now features 15 companies delivering proven circular solutions:

| Company | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Bricks | Reclaimed bricks |
| Board Producer | Panels from milk cartons |
| Nester (DK) | Bike sheds from reclaimed wood |
| Entree (NO) | Building materials from reclaimed wood |
| Carbonade | Precast concrete with captured CO2 |
| Nordic Circle | Steel beams from marine steel |
| Bilt | Building renovation/transformation |
| ReCircle | Leading rehabilitation services |
| Make a BIM (FI) | AI-powered BIM modeling |
| FIRA (FI) | Interior and fabric air ventilation |

The ambition: scale from 15 to 100 best circular solutions across the Nordics, creating a **market accelerator program** connecting supply with demand.

"Today, if you ask many property owners and clients, even in Natural State where I also work, they don't really know that these things exist," Odegard admitted. Visibility is half the battle.

## The Missing Ingredient: Goals

The session's clearest call to action came from Odegard's closing observation: **no Nordic politician has yet committed to specific circularity targets for construction**.

"Until now, I haven't found one politician who can say, we're going to be this much circular in construction to achieve our climate and nature goals," he stated. "Amsterdam has done it—50% circular by 2030. We should do it. Because as long as we don't have clear goals, it's very hard to set the policies accordingly."

## Key Takeaways

1. **Nordic construction circularity lags ambition** - despite 2030 sustainability goals, the sector remains largely linear
2. **Build less, use more** - 200,000+ unused buildings exist in Norway alone; adaptive reuse could meet housing targets
3. **Regulation blocks innovation** - circular materials face barriers while virgin materials enjoy advantages
4. **Heritage holds answers** - 900 years of biodegradable building in Iceland offers lessons for regenerative futures
5. **Collaboration accelerates progress** - moving together across Nordic borders enables faster learning
6. **Goals drive policy** - without specific circularity targets, meaningful change remains elusive

## The Path Forward

As Karlsdottir concluded: "Iceland sits at an interesting crossroads. Our scale makes industrial competition difficult, but it also gives us agility, proximity, and the potential for rapid systemic change. Circular construction here is not only a technical challenge, but a cultural and political one."

The same could be said for the entire Nordic region. The tools exist. The knowledge is accumulating. The regulations are slowly shifting. What's needed now is political will, clear goals, and the courage to challenge vested interests.

"A traditional house in Norway is one that you can disassemble," Odegard reminded participants. "We have to look back to find a way for the future."
