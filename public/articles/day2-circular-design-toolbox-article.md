# The Circular Design Toolbox: Making Circular Transition Practical

**Estonian sustainability designers unveil open-source methodology for business transformation**

*November 20, 2025 | Digital Partner Session, Nordic Circular Summit 2025*

In a world where the linear economy grows faster than circular solutions can scale, two Estonian sustainability designers introduced a practical tool to help companies bridge the gap. The Circular Design Toolbox, developed by HI Advisory with support from Enterprise Estonia and the European Union, offers a step-by-step methodology for businesses seeking to integrate circular thinking into their operations.

## The Context: A Linear Economy That Won't Slow Down

Dan Mikkin, Partner at HI Advisory, opened with a sobering assessment: "The linear economy is heavily dominating the world. And it's not moving in the right direction. We have just the recent data coming in and it's getting worse. Not that we are having less circular solutions, but the linear economy is growing even faster."

The urgency is underscored by planetary boundaries. In 2025, ocean acidification crossed the threshold where damage exceeds the ocean's capacity for self-repair—another boundary breached.

### The Donut Economics Vision

The toolbox draws inspiration from Kate Raworth's Donut Economics model, which combines planetary boundaries with social foundations. The goal: help companies find the "sweet spot" where human needs are met within environmental limits.

"We can all have good lives, being educated, being free, being well-fed and having enough water to drink. And we can do that within these planetary boundaries," Mikkin explained. "This is something that we strive for. And this is why we created this toolbox."

## The Foundation: R Strategies and Design Thinking

### Ten Pathways to Circularity

The toolbox builds on the Ellen MacArthur Foundation's R Strategies framework—ten distinct approaches to becoming more circular:

1. **Refuse** - eliminate harmful materials or activities
2. **Rethink** - redesign from first principles
3. **Reduce** - minimize resource use
4. **Reuse** - extend product life through secondary use
5. **Repair** - fix to extend functionality
6. **Refurbish** - restore to like-new condition
7. **Remanufacture** - rebuild using recovered components
8. **Repurpose** - use products for different purposes
9. **Recycle** - recover materials for new products
10. **Regenerate** - restore and enhance environments

The ultimate goal sits at the top: business models that leave surroundings in a better state than before. "What can we give back to the environment as companies?" Mikkin asked.

### The Double Diamond Process

The toolbox adapts the British Design Council's Double Diamond methodology:

| Phase | Activity | Tools |
|-------|----------|-------|
| **Understand** | Map current situation, stakeholders, inefficiencies | 6 tools |
| **Define** | Narrow to new value proposition | 3 tools |
| **Ideate** | Generate and prioritize solutions | 3 tools |
| **Develop** | Create roadmap for implementation | 3 tools |

"We have been using it throughout our own processes," noted Maarja Karlson, Partner at HI Advisory, "and for each stage we have a set of tools."

## The Business Case: Why Design Matters for Circularity

From an economic perspective, companies pursuing circular transformation typically seek:

1. **Economic gains** - greater efficiency in material use
2. **Risk management** - regulatory compliance, reduced dependency on scarce materials
3. **Competitive advantage** - clear customer targeting, brand value built on substance

Design isn't just about aesthetics—it's a structured process for achieving these business objectives.

## The Toolbox Architecture

### 15 Tools Across Four Stages

Each tool follows a consistent architecture:
- **Purpose and goals** - what the tool achieves
- **Step-by-step instructions** - self-guided process
- **Difficulty level** - some tools require expert facilitation
- **Additional resources** - curated best practices
- **Worksheets** - practical templates to complete
- **Tips and examples** - guidance from practitioners

### Self-Assessment: The Starting Point

Before diving into design, companies complete an eight-question self-assessment. The purpose isn't to score highest, but to establish an honest baseline.

"Be as objective as you can, be realistic," Karlson advised. "From there you get really the situation and also the parts where you can build on."

The assessment positions companies on a "circularity ladder":

| Level | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Conventional** | Play by the book, no circularity initiative |
| **Green** | Good mindset, circularity limited to waste management |
| **Sustainable** | Circularity as goal, but not core to business model |
| **Restorative** | Circularity as core business model component |
| **Regenerative** | Pioneer companies that give back more than they take |

"Regenerative organizations are these rare pioneering companies which actually restore the environment around them so that they give back more than they take from nature and from society," Mikkin explained.

## Key Tools in Detail

### Value Chain Mapping (Tool #4)

This tool maps your current value chain across seven stages:
1. Design
2. Materials sourcing
3. Manufacturing
4. Distribution
5. Marketing
6. Sales
7. End of life

For each stage, teams assess:
- Required resources
- Critical stakeholders
- Inefficiencies
- Macro-level influences (EU regulations, industry standards)

Critical insight: identify which stages you control versus those controlled by partners. "You still have to understand what goes on at stages you don't control because you can decide whether to use these partners or not."

### Partner Personas (Define Stage)

Beyond user personas familiar from service design, the toolbox introduces partner personas—deep understanding of suppliers, investors, and key stakeholders.

**Example: Wooden panels producer mapping a coatings supplier**

The partner (Ann, a production manager) revealed:
- Company aware of circularity due to EU regulations
- But readiness to change isn't high
- Values safety of her team above all (hazardous fumes)
- Challenges: small batch custom orders are inconvenient

**Opportunity discovered**: Open to R&D for bio-based alternatives if orders are large enough to secure cash flow.

"What is especially important with circular collaborations are the partners," Karlson emphasized. "You want to understand their needs and challenges as well."

### Ideation Tool (Ideate Stage)

Based on the "lotus blossom" brainstorming method, this tool integrates five key R strategies as prompts:

1. **REFUSE**: Could we refuse some harmful materials or activities?
2. **REDUCE**: If refusing isn't possible, could we reduce something?
3. **REPLACE**: Could we replace harmful with beneficial?
4. **EXTEND LIFECYCLE**: Can we repair, remanufacture, or offer as service?
5. **REGENERATE**: Can we restore the environment through our products?

"It can be a small thing," Karlson noted—"replace some chemicals, change packaging, or offer products as a service where people lease instead of own."

### Circular Business Model Canvas (Tool #14)

This canvas integrates everything discovered and decided into one view:

**Center**: New value proposition (ideally one sentence) + Business value goal

**Left Side** (Users & Communication):
- Critical users and participants
- Communication channels
- Information/insight gathering methods

**Right Side** (Partners & Resources):
- Critical partners enabling circular model
- Required actions
- New or existing resource streams

**Bottom** (Financial Model):
- Transition costs
- Possible revenue
- Profit timeline

**Outer Layer** (Environment & Society):
- Environmental/social impacts
- Regenerative goals

"If it adds up, then it all makes sense," Mikkin stated clearly. "If it doesn't, then it's a charity project. We are talking about actual working business models."

## Practical Considerations

### How Many Tools Do Companies Need?

Not all 15. "A good efficient transition process usually takes five, six, seven tools over a course of several months," Mikkin explained. The depth depends on the transformation's scope.

### Digital or Physical?

The toolbox currently lives in Miro (digital collaborative platform) but can be printed for live workshops. HI Advisory is exploring AI integration for greater efficiency and accessibility.

### Do Companies Need Expert Help?

Tools are designed for self-use, but "a good sustainability designer could give you a hand," especially for higher-difficulty tools.

## The Path to Regeneration

The toolbox's ultimate ambition: helping companies reach regenerative status. Inspiration cards within the toolset showcase real cases of businesses that give back to nature while applying various R strategies.

For companies starting their journey, the immediate goal is more modest: honest assessment, systematic understanding, and practical first steps.

"The most difficult part is usually taking the first step," Mikkin acknowledged. The 100 Days Implementation Plan tool addresses exactly this: "What would we do in the first 100 days? Critical to get your transition started."

## Where to Access the Toolbox

The Circular Design Toolbox is available as an open-source resource:
- **Enterprise Estonia website** - full toolbox download
- **Nordic Circular Hotspot** - project page with context
- **HI Advisory** - pilot sessions and facilitation

HI Advisory is actively seeking pilot companies for deeper engagement, with plans to iterate the toolbox into an increasingly digital, AI-assisted solution.

## Closing Thought

In a session focused on practical methodology, the underlying message was clear: circular transformation isn't just about sustainability ambition—it's about business viability.

"We are talking about actual working business models. This has to add up."

The Circular Design Toolbox offers a structured path from aspiration to action, from understanding to implementation. For companies ready to move beyond pilots to practice, the tools are now available.

"Get circular," Mikkin concluded. The toolbox shows how.
