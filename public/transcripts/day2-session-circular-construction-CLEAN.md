## Part 1: Introduction and Session Overview

**Jan Thomas Odegard:** Hello and welcome to this partner session at the Nordic Circular Summit 2025. We are going to talk about construction and circularity in construction. The title is "From Pilots to Practice - Next Steps to Scale Circular Construction in the Nordics". We will have an Icelandic perspective, we will have a government perspective, and more general, a private sector perspective. So with me, I have two people that have joined me. It's Anna Karlsdottir from Ludica Architects in Iceland. Welcome, Anna. And also Helle Redder Momsen from Nordic Network for Sustainable Construction. Welcome, Helle.

**Helle Redder Momsen:** Thank you very much.

**Jan Thomas Odegard:** So the project I represent, Nordic Circular Construction, is actually one of four projects being supported by Nordic Innovation about this subject. The Nordic Sustainable Construction Network of Helle maybe is being funded by Nordic Council of Ministers, which is sort of the same budget. And then we have two other projects going in parallel, which is quite interesting because we're trying to learn from each other. I will bring some of the learnings with me today from at least three of the projects and then we'll hear from also from Helle on the government side.

So in the project I am involved in, we have 16 companies that are involved and our aim is to support them in upscaling their circular construction solutions in the Nordics. I will come more back to that later.

---

## Part 2: Nordic Sustainability Challenges

**Jan Thomas Odegard:** So we all know that the Nordics are very ambitious on sustainability. Actually the Nordic as a region wants to be the most sustainable and integrated region in the world by 2030. But circularity in general is very low. That's among some of the lowest. So that's a bit of a challenge. And of course construction is one of the sectors that are big on emissions, natural resource use and waste. But both the goals and the practice today of the sector scores low on sustainability. So obviously, we have some challenges.

And these challenges have been studied in numerous reports. So we're not going to go through all of those. But let's say we can summarize them in seven or eight points, the most common challenges:

1. **Linear domination** - it's cheaper to buy and discard virgin materials still
2. **Policy limitations** favoring linear business - no requirement for reuse of building materials yet
3. **Public procurement** - lots of intentions but not driving circularity demand yet at any scale
4. **Immature market** - fragmented, value chain not stronger than the weakest link
5. **Trust issues** - people don't trust circular products, lack competence about using them
6. **Low risk appetite** in the sector
7. **Small reuse market** - few reuse hubs, long distances, timing mismatch in demolishing and reuse needs
8. **Slow times in construction** - limited appetite to experiment

And we must admit that there has been a political turn in several Nordic countries where there is less interest in sustainability, partly because of the war and crisis management, but also just how much you emphasize sustainability.

---

## Part 3: Goals and Pathways

**Jan Thomas Odegard:** So where are we going to go and how are we going to get there? We know all about the Paris goals, the COP is going on in Brazil as we speak. Most Nordic countries have promised to cut 55% of their CO2 emissions by 2030. A nature deal called the Kunming-Montreal Agreement - we have to preserve 30 percent of nature, reduce the impact on nature.

And basically, we must change our resources. There's a fairly unknown UN scientific panel called the Global Resources Panel. They say that more than 50 percent of all CO2 emissions and most of nature use comes from resource use. So we have to change our resource use.

Amsterdam is one of the pioneers in construction. They want to be 50% circular in construction by 2030. A recent paper this year in Denmark said that Denmark must reduce its new construction with 80% by 2030 to reach its goals. And a report in Norway from last year said that we have to reduce material use in construction by 72% by 2030. So if we are to reach our sustainability goals, which we have to, then we really, really have to do changes in the way we do construction.

So how to get there? Well, business as usual is the wrong way. Decarbonization going from high carbon to low carbon products is an important contribution, but the most obvious and most important effort is in the circular building scenario.

If we look at a traditional framework like the **9R framework**, there are many ways to be circular and to different degrees. And of course to avoid necessary buildings and transform buildings is like the best way and then just to recycle materials is the least intense way.

---

## Part 4: Nordic Maturity Assessment

**Jan Thomas Odegard:** So in the Nordics, if we make an estimate of our maturity in the circular construction, I've tried to sort of put up the different countries on the different levels:

- **Netherlands** - circular pioneer (benchmark)
- **Denmark and Finland** - leading
- **Sweden** - follows
- **Norway** - next
- **Iceland** - catching up
- **Greenland** - basically starting from scratch

That's basically because we have a new report saying that Greenland is basically starting a bit from scratch, which is fair enough. It's very challenging to get these systems up and running in Greenland, small society.

But of course, we would want to have all the Nordic countries move towards Netherlands. And one of the ideas of this seminar is that if we move together, learn from each other, then we can move faster.

So we have two axes:
1. **Regulatory maturity** - how we can promote ambition and harmonization in Nordic regulation
2. **Market side** - how we can stimulate better supply and demand

---

## Part 5: Building Less and Building Smart

**Jan Thomas Odegard:** To build nothing new - for many people, that's a very strange concept. We have to build new all the time, don't we? But actually, there is a movement starting in the Nordic countries. In Denmark, it's called the **Building Stop Movement**. In Europe, it's called **Sufficiency Movement**. And it is developing into a law-ish thing in Denmark - "preserve or explain," or in Danish, "bevare eller forklare." And actually, the new Finnish building law has elements of this.

So there is this increasing awareness that we need to use more what we have. And actually, there is quite a bit of space, free space and space we can use better, which needs a new kind of thinking.

Helsinki has loads of office space that was abandoned during COVID. Now they're trying to take that into housing space. And several calculations from both Norway and Denmark shows that if we just take 10% of the big houses, where only one or two people live, and we separate small flats from them, we can have 130,000 buildings both in Norway and Denmark. And 130,000 is actually the amount of new houses that the Norwegian government wants to see within next five years.

Where I work we just released a report showing that we have more than 200,000 unused buildings in the districts of Norway. That's a lot for a small country and the main challenge is regulations, competence in reusing these and funding but we have through this project that we just launched shown that it is quite possible.

---

## Part 6: Building with the Right Materials

**Jan Thomas Odegard:** So the next topic is how can we build with the right materials? And I guess the general development in the Nordics is that we're moving from brute demolition, where everything is just being scrapped and crushed and made into waste, to **material harvesting**.

The picture you see, I took it yesterday - it's from the new Norwegian broadcasting company building site, where a Danish company has drawn the new building and they are doing this material harvesting, picking it apart bit by bit. So it's happening.

Most countries have a requirement to map the materials and they have to sort it, but there is no real requirement to reuse it. The EU says that we should by this year reuse or recycle 70%. Norway is horribly far behind. Most other countries are too. I think Denmark is leading the pack in this, but maybe mostly on the recycling part.

In Norway, we regrettably have a number of disincentives:
- Hardly any landfilling fees
- Taxes that encourage demolition
- A huge energy recovery sector that wants the material

But Denmark is a bit ahead. You have introduced a new law in selective deconstruction, have a max on your CO2 per square meter, maybe not very advanced yet, but it's a really important concept. And then you have this zero CO2 in reuse materials.

---

## Part 7: Reuse Hubs and Market Development

**Jan Thomas Odegard:** So one of the things that we've looked at is reuse hubs. They are growing in number and spreading. Most of them are private, they're small, but they're mainly catered to individuals or more idealistic smaller businesses.

I guess the biggest challenge in this part is that there is no one catering to the business-to-business segment with the necessary volumes, availability, quality, certified products and price. So they are all saying these products need to be as available as all the normal materials. So the question is, will this be enough and will this model survive?

When it comes to the property developers, they need easy access. And actually, there's a development in Denmark which is interesting, where one of the big Home Depot companies, Stark, are now presenting materials from circular companies like Bricks. So that could be the next step where these products actually come out to where the entrepreneurs and the builders actually buy them.

---

## Part 8: Circular Construction Product Catalog

**Jan Thomas Odegard:** So one of the things that we have done with our project is we're trying to develop what we call a **Circular Construction Product Catalog**. And we have so far 15 companies that are involved here. And they are both products and services.

The idea is to make this catalog available to property owners and developers. So they can look into, for instance, there's one with bricks - we give all the essential information about the bricks and they can check: is this satisfying? Is it the volumes? Is it the price?

We have different kinds here:
- **Bricks** - reclaimed bricks
- **Board producer** - made from milk cartons
- **Danish Nester** - makes bike sheds from reclaimed wood (wonderful collaboration with demolition companies)
- **Entree (Norway)** - making new building material with reclaimed wood
- **Textile from Iceland**
- **Danish Arup** - more services
- **Carbonade** - makes precast concrete with captured CO2
- **Nordic Circle** - makes steel beams from marine steel
- **Bilt** - specializes in renovation/transformation of buildings
- **ReCircle** - leading rehab company
- **Make a BIM (Finland)** - creates BIM models with AI, speeds it up tremendously
- **FIRA (Finland)** - Interior and Fabric Air Ventilation

These are 15 companies who actually can deliver these things. And we think the next step for us would be to make a **market accelerator program**, which basically means we make a catalog, maybe we get the 15 to 100 best circular solutions in the Nordics. We offer this platform for the ones who have the different products. And then we also invite the demand side in.

The next step is having access to information, understanding if these products are available or not, what their prices and what their certification and qualities - that's the key. And today, if you ask many of the property owners and our clients, even in Natural State where I also work, they don't really know that these things exist.

So from that, I'm going to then introduce Anna from Ludica in Iceland, who will give us a perspective on where circular is in Iceland. So go ahead and share your presentation. The word is yours. Thank you.

---

## Part 9: Iceland's Built Heritage

**Anna Karlsdottir:** Thank you Jan. So good morning and hello everyone. Really happy to be here. I'm an architect from Iceland. I co-founded Ludica Architects with my partner Jan, a different Jan from you.

In our practice, we seek to examine, interrogate, and question what works, what doesn't, and what could be made better, as we believe that a fundamental rethink is needed in how we approach building and design. We think our societal material culture has to change if we are to meet the ecological challenges of our time. So we therefore dedicate a significant part of our work to research and experimentation, exploring alternatives to the dominant extractive construction paradigm.

So today I'll be speaking about circular construction in Iceland, the challenges we face, and the opportunities we have to accelerate the transition as we are lagging behind.

I thought to start by giving a brief introduction to the built heritage in Iceland, as I think it's quite relevant and unique in many respects. Our construction history begins with the settlement in the 9th century when the first inhabitants built dwellings from turf, stone and timber, using techniques that were then common across the North Atlantic.

As most neighbouring countries gradually developed towards purely wooden construction, in Iceland people continued to live in turf houses well into the 20th century. The image here is of **Kjeldur**, which is the oldest existing turf farmhouse in Iceland that dates back to the 12th century.

It wasn't until the 19th century that turf farms began to decline as timber and masonry construction became more widespread and by the 20th century concrete had taken over as the dominant building material. But still at this time construction was largely based on domestic raw materials, local stone formation and Icelandic cement for concrete. Timber had to be imported due to deforestation and lack of forestry resources.

And concrete eventually gained the upper hand and today **approximately 80% of Icelandic buildings are made of concrete**. This represents an enormous shift as for nearly 900 years we built structures that were biodegradable, required constant care and returned to the earth when they were no longer in use. In contrast, our modern material systems are permanent, resource-intensive and environmentally burdensome.

---

## Part 10: Global Context and Iceland's Position

**Anna Karlsdottir:** So we live in a totally different reality today, not only in Iceland and the Nordics, but globally. Open borders, globalised trade and increased transportation have created a construction industry where materials are extracted in one place, processed in another, and assembled somewhere else entirely. Large international corporations dominate production, and this system is underpinned by carbon-intensive processes, pollution, and profound social inequalities.

I think it's important to have the global overview, because we're all facing the same problems, even though each country has its own challenges. The problem has been identified, and we know what has to change. **The real challenge lies in the implementation** - how to shift from linear extraction to circular, regenerative systems in a meaningful and effective way.

Iceland faces a slightly different reality compared to the Scandinavian countries. We are an island nation with historically limited access to building material beyond stone, turf and driftwood. Our harsh climate, along with earthquakes and volcanic activity, makes a unique testing ground for construction methods and materials.

We do currently lag behind in the transition from linear to circular construction. Contributing factors include:
- Small population size
- Fragmented markets
- Significant information gaps

However, many of these gaps have now been identified and in some cases addressed.

---

## Part 11: Iceland's Recycling Statistics

**Anna Karlsdottir:** As you see on the graph here, this is taken from the Icelandic sustainable constructions roadmap to 2030. Between 2015 and 2020, the yearly recycling ratio for building and demolition waste averaged 88%, while disposal stood at 12%. The target for 2030 is to reduce the disposal to 5% and increase recycling to 95%.

On the surface, this appeared really promising. However, **the majority of this recycling consists of mixed mineral waste used for backfilling**, which doesn't equate to high-value circular use. The picture, therefore, is more complex and far less optimistic, unfortunately.

Ultimately, our goal should be to eliminate waste entirely, and what better teacher than nature? In natural systems, linear chains of cause and effect are rare. Instead, ecosystems function through cyclical processes where waste from one organism becomes food for another. Sustainability is not an individual property, but a characteristic of an entire web of relationships. It always involves a community. And this is exactly, I think, what we're doing today.

Just as nature thrives through interdependence and adaptability, our built environment should be designed with resilience in mind. However, current economic and regulatory systems prioritize short-term profits over long-term ecological and social well-being.

---

## Part 12: Qualitative vs Quantitative Growth

**Anna Karlsdottir:** As an architect, I increasingly see development not as a quantitative growth, but as a qualitative transformation - the ability of systems to evolve, adapt, and generate new forms of life. Creativity is, after all, a key property of living systems. We wouldn't be here without it.

Most economists reduce the word development to a single dimension - typically per capita GDP. This crude indicator sums up all monetary activities without regard for their social or environmental consequences. It ignores unpaid labour, community resilience, ecosystem service and cultural value.

Global capitalism treats air, water, soil and social relations as expendable commodities. Private profit is generated at public costs leading to pollution, resource depletion and social fragmentation. **The belief in unlimited growth on a finite planet is fundamentally flawed.**

What we need is **qualitative growth** - a growth that regenerates rather than exploits. In architecture, this shift is clearly visible in the idea that the most environmentally friendly building is the one that already exists, like Jan said earlier. This is where circular construction and bio-based building practices intersect. Both are about extending life cycles, minimizing resource extraction, and redefining what progress really means.

---

## Part 13: The Hamkrid Hempcrete Project

**Anna Karlsdottir:** So I want to give an example of one of our projects. When I moved back to Iceland with my partners after living for a decade in London, we were struck by how deeply dependent Iceland is on imports and concrete. As it happened, it was just about the same time when it had become legal to import industrial hemp seeds. And that coincidence sparked the idea for our bio-building project.

We asked ourselves a simple question: **What if we designed and built a structure using locally sourced natural materials? Could we demonstrate an alternative material future for Icelandic construction?** Because living in a small, agile society meant that experimentation felt possible. Things can happen really quickly in Iceland if the right conditions align.

We started out by growing the hemp locally, but ultimately used imported hemp for the hempcrete due to technical and logistical constraints, but that's a story for another day.

The project resulted in **Iceland's first temporary building constructed using proven techniques** adapted from international precedents. We set out with clear parameters:
- Use local and natural building materials
- Minimize ground intervention
- Design for disassembly and reuse
- Share our knowledge openly

Our first major obstacle was regulation. Without CE marking or declaration of performance for the building materials, the building couldn't receive a standard building permit. But we did find a workaround - to keep the structure under 15 m² and 2.5 m in height. **Innovation literally operated within a loophole.**

---

## Part 14: Iceland's Information Gap

**Anna Karlsdottir:** This process revealed a profound information gap. Reliable data on local materials was almost impossible to find. You needed to know a guy who knew a guy who might know a guy. We made a lot of good connections and friendships in the process, but this was really time-consuming and ineffective.

Incredibly, **no official statistics exist from the year 2010 about total building material imports**. What we do know is that the reliance is extreme. In response, we have begun systematically collecting and analyzing the data to better understand Iceland's material flows and vulnerabilities.

In the Hamkrid building, we did manage in the end to use:
- Local structural timber
- Icelandic timber larch cladding
- Rock wool insulation
- Red scoria for the pathways
- Seaweed for paper experiments and foundation

So in that sense, the project became both a building and a research platform, and what we hope, potentially a prototype for alternative futures.

---

## Part 15: Icelandic Building Regulations

**Anna Karlsdottir:** These are the Icelandic building regulations that aim to balance safety, sustainability, innovation, and efficiency. On paper, you could even say they are almost progressive, but in reality, they often hinder innovation and reinforce outdated industrial standards.

For example, our Hamkrid project was criticized for being too small to provide useful monitoring data, despite the fact that the size limitation was imposed by the very same regulation. **The paradox highlights quite beautifully the rigidity of the existing system.**

Compounding the problem is **the absence of a national building research institute**. This was available in Iceland but was closed down, and without this, experimental knowledge has no formal institutional home.

---

## Part 16: Future Matters Initiative

**Anna Karlsdottir:** Out of the Hamkrid project emerged another initiative, which is **Future Matters**. This is a collaborative research project with Trípuli architectar and Gísli Rafa Magnusson.

In the project we are exploring Iceland's architectural heritage, current construction practices and possible future pathways. We ask whether Iceland can reduce its dependency on imported materials by revitalizing craftsmanship, reactivating local material use and combining historic knowledge with contemporary innovation.

We hope for it to function as:
- A toolkit for change
- A knowledge repository
- A platform for experimental practice
- A critical review of policy and regulation
- A stakeholder network

So Future Matters addresses the information vacuum by systematically collecting and analyzing historical and contemporary material data. We have been, just in the last summer, visiting many places. We're collecting samples and historical data in an effort to respond directly to the status quo and seeking to reclaim lost knowledge.

---

## Part 17: Key Discoveries in Iceland

**Anna Karlsdottir:** Our key discoveries so far - we have identified clear patterns of:

**Challenges:**
- Loss of research infrastructure
- Decline in local manufacturing
- Forgotten material techniques and historical innovation using local resources
- Globalized economic pressure
- Limited market scale
- No research facility

**Opportunities:**
- Rich material heritage
- Experiential and experimental potential
- Regenerative possibilities
- Opportunity to shift value creation to local contexts

Iceland used to be, after the Second World War, really innovative. This is pumice from Hekla that was used to make building blocks and this is a house that still stands - it was unclad for almost 20 years. And this is red scoria that also was made into building blocks - these are houses from the 70s and 80s that still stand.

We also found instances of **rammed earth**. There was a rammed earth building that was only just torn down at the beginning of this year. We only found out too late unfortunately, but it had been standing for 100 years, proving that rammed earth is also possible in some parts of Iceland.

And we're thinking: **if concrete brought Iceland to modernity, what brings us into a regenerative future?**

---

## Part 18: Iceland's Unique Position

**Anna Karlsdottir:** Iceland sits at an interesting crossroads. Our scale makes industrial competition difficult, but it also gives us agility, proximity and the potential for rapid systemic change.

**Circular construction here is not only a technical challenge, but a cultural and political one.**

By reconnecting with our material heritage, investing in research, reforming regulations and supporting experimentation, we believe we can begin to imagine new material futures that are rooted in resilience and regenerative. Thank you very much.

**Jan Thomas Odegard:** Thank you, Anna. That was very, very inspiring. I had contact with one Icelandic company called Steinull, you mentioned them. They use some volcanic sand and the energy from renewable energy and actually making insulation materials. And they are operating quite well and even exporting, I think. So there are also some of that business still existing.

We'll get back to discussing a bit later, but I want to get more of the government perspective, maybe not government, but the official approach to this through a Nordic collaboration. Helle, please share your thoughts with us.

---

## Part 19: Nordic Government Collaboration

**Helle Redder Momsen:** Thank you very much and thank you for inviting me. I've been looking very much forward to being here. I really enjoy the presentations both of you have made. I think, like you said really nicely, Anna, it means so much when we get together and share the good examples and of course also the challenges together and get different perspectives of the things.

I will share with you now what the Nordic countries are collaborating on to accelerate circularity in construction. I am currently in Nuuk, but I live in Denmark, where I work at the **Danish Authority of Social Services and Housing**. And I'm part of this **Nordic Sustainable Construction Collaboration**, and we're a lot of good colleagues from all the Nordic countries together working to improve the green, digital and circular transition in the construction sector.

I don't know if you all know, you mentioned it, Jan, but the Nordic countries have this vision that within five years to be the most sustainable and integrated region in the world. I think all of us working with construction and housing know that to reach close to that, our built environment is key - and the way we use it and the way we transition it.

---

## Part 20: Nordic Ministers' Declaration 2023

**Helle Redder Momsen:** The Nordic ministers of housing and construction agree, and that's why they have made a declaration. This one is from 2023, where they say different things - that we should work towards a low carbon solution and integrate circular principles in our construction and building sector.

I highlighted one of the things: **They recognized the potential in preserving and developing the existing building stock as a contribution to reduced emissions.** So this was a focus that was put in 2023.

We had a collaboration running from 2021 to 2024, where we focused on different things. But in a new collaboration, the existing building stock is a key focus that we collaborate on. So we have this collaboration from before the summer break in June until the end of 2027, where we have the opportunity to work on these topics.

Today I will focus on the circularity work package. So it's all the Nordic countries, construction authorities who work together on this. The countries who have said we want to take a lead in one of these work packages are responsible for implementation. But it doesn't mean that Finland, the Faroe Islands, Greenland, Norway isn't active - they contribute with input and they follow the work. So it is a Nordic collaboration.

---

## Part 21: The Existing Building Stock Potential

**Helle Redder Momsen:** The reason why we talk about these existing buildings is because, like Jan was saying, we see that there is a huge potential in reaching this Nordic vision by having a stronger focus on our existing building stocks.

There was a previous collaboration called **Beyond Zero** that built on a lot of old knowledge, and some of the things they highlighted I want to share with you here. They ask the question: **at which pace can we consume materials which have taken billions of years to form?**

They also point to the fact that circular economy is often understood as the recycling or the reuse of materials, but **an important goal is to extend the lifespan of the buildings and the materials within them that we already have**.

And then they had this little saying that I just think was really nice and good, so I brought it with me today: **"The most sustainable building is the one that is kept in use and loved."**

So to be able to utilize existing buildings more, it's of course important that there's someone to maintain them and take care of them.

---

## Part 22: The Building Hierarchy Triangle

**Helle Redder Momsen:** When I took this triangle with me, you had another version of it, Jan - it really spins off from the architecture policy in Finland from 2022, where Matti Kutten made this shape.

This version that I took with me is very easy to understand. It says:

1. **First** - use what is already there and use it for what it was meant to be useful
2. **Then** - prolong the lifetime with maintenance and care
3. **If not possible** - renovate it, change use and transform
4. **If you need more space** - extend the existing
5. **If all of that is not possible** - then build new (and you can also build with reused products)

And of course, it matters what kind of products you will build with.

---

## Part 23: Challenges and Opportunities

**Helle Redder Momsen:** So it's just the intro and of course the reason why these challenges are there and the opportunities in existing buildings is that it's a mix of things that give a negative footprint from our existing building stock:

- Greenhouse emissions
- Depletion of virgin resources
- A lot of waste in the process
- Biodiversity loss
- Eutrophication
- A lot of chemicals
- Sometimes push to the social balance

So we believe that having a larger focus on the existing buildings and possible use of them, it can be solutions both to housing shortage, health crisis, sustainability and affordability.

---

## Part 24: Nine Policy Measures

**Helle Redder Momsen:** In the circularity work package, we have four tasks that we are slowly starting up and trying to work with. The first was to really try to gather the good examples, because we know that there's a lot already. Jan, you shared some, Anna, you shared others, and I keep hearing new ones, which is of course very inspiring.

So what we use our resources on is to try to see what policy measures are there to optimize the use of the existing. And our initial mapping is the **nine measures** that you see here:

1. **Lifetime extension**
2. **Demolition** (prevention/criteria)
3. **Remove barriers for efficient renovation**
4. **Multi-use and efficient utilization of square meters**
5. **Incentives and tax instruments**
6. **Design optimization**
7. **Design for disassembly**
8. **The procurement muscle**
9. **Research, demonstration and piloting**

---

## Part 25: Nordic Climate Forum Findings

**Helle Redder Momsen:** A few weeks ago, we held the yearly **Nordic Climate Forum for Construction**. It's a thing that the Nordic construction authorities have started - it was started, I think, by Finland and Sweden. This year it was Denmark who hosted it.

This year the focus was on two topics:
1. How to make life cycle assessment calculations more effectively
2. How to optimise the use of existing square metres

All the Nordic countries' construction authorities and Estonian construction authorities shared slides on what they are doing to motivate this. The EU Commission had a really interesting presentation of what they are looking into.

And here is a first feedback from some of the findings we had from the talk there, and some of the things that they prioritised:

1. **Lifetime extension** - key driver
2. **Prevention of unnecessary demolition and criteria for demolition** - second
3. **Remove regulatory barriers for efficient renovation** - third
4. **Incentives and tax instruments** - fourth
5. **Research, demonstration and piloting** - fifth

---

## Part 26: Implementation Details

**Helle Redder Momsen:** **Lifetime extension** can be done in many ways:
- Relaxation of regulation regarding changed use of a building
- Economic incentives - should it be easier to maintain?
- Minimise the amount of demolition
- Long-term planning and knowing the history of the building

**Remove barriers for efficient renovation:**
- How can you overcome some of the regulatory barriers when you renovate?
- How can you make renovation the easy choice and not to demolish?
- Some authorities are also looking into the definition of resource efficiency

**Multi-use and efficient utilisation of square metres:**
- You mentioned that Jan, that there is a lot of potential in square meters that are there, but not used
- But how do you actually measure it? And what measurement do you use to identify that potential?

**Demolition:**
- Some people say that you may not say demolition as long as you say taking down the building
- Maybe there could be made criteria or other ways of minimizing the amount of demolition

---

## Part 27: Reused Products Assessment

**Helle Redder Momsen:** Then another task is how to use more reused products - if it's not possible to keep the building but you have to take it down, how can we then use these materials in the best possible way?

We identified in an old report from 2023 that we need to reduce the insecurity and the risk associated with using reused materials.

When we do the LCA calculation, we map what the different countries, how they value a reuse product. **Most countries say it should be zero.** And that's not because it is zero, but it's to motivate a market for reuse. And then some countries include that you have to calculate the emissions from transport and some also from a bit of dealing with the product.

But to overcome the risk and the insecurity, one way could be to **make assessment methods for reuse products**. And to do that, we want to make a mapping of what methods are already there. If you know of an assessment method for a specific reused construction product, then you're most welcome to send the information to us on email.

But could we make a **Nordic method** that can be shared and also contribute to the construction product regulation process happening in EU?

---

## Part 28: Skills and Education

**Helle Redder Momsen:** Then we have the last one - I don't have time to go into task three, not because it's not important. It's extremely important. But time is time.

So the skills - we can talk a lot about maintenance, but people need to have the skills needed. So in the last programme phase, we made this **online education materials** targeted to teachers who teach carpenters and bricklayers, but often they don't have good education materials concerning construction and sustainability.

But we have it here online with nice introductions to the teachers. It's online, you have quizzes, you have facts, you have easy readable text and it is in **six Nordic languages** - not Greenlandic, but otherwise many of our languages and also in English. And you are most welcome to use it for free.

Yes, that was it. Thank you.

## Part 29: Session Closing

**Jan Thomas Odegard:** Thank you so much, Helle. That was a very good update on how you're working on these things. I think we only have a couple of minutes left, so we won't have time for a long discussion.

But what I see quite clearly is that **the regulations are being challenged, but they are still very much favoring the linear way of doing things**. So we need a big shift there. Of course, we shouldn't be naive. Those who are in linear production have interest in linear ways of doing things. They are resisting - huge economic interest. In Norway, the construction industry is the biggest industry, and a huge interest there.

And we need to try to get on board the big companies, because we see that when the big companies come in and they see this as an opportunity and not a threat, then things can go. And I think that is one of our challenges now. We're working with many small companies. They don't have the volume, they're not so known. But if we try to get the demand side on board, and they can sort of give also input to what they need, I think that can change things.

But also we've seen just the last year in Norway with lots of pressure, the awareness among politicians on circularity has actually improved quite a bit. It's a new area. Although some will say circularity - that's what we did before. Like you were saying Anna, this is where we originally come from.

**A traditional house in Norway is one that you can disassemble.** And the Danes love it as their summer house even. You can pick it apart and then move it around. So I think we have to look back to find a way for the future. But we have to challenge the legal structures, we have to challenge the vested interest.

## Part 30: Call to Action

**Jan Thomas Odegard:** But we also, I think it's critical, **we need to set goals**. Because until now, I haven't found one politician who can say, we're going to be this much circular in construction to achieve our climate and nature goals.

And actually Amsterdam has done it, and we should do it because as long as we don't have clear goals, it's very hard to set the policies accordingly. So I hope that will be a possible next step in a collaboration - what will be the right goals so that we can, through the Nordic platform, encourage the countries.

Of course, the Nordic does not have a legal force to say we're going to do this. So it's always like trying to encourage them, but we all have to take this agenda back to our home ground and then try to influence from there.

So I just want to say Anna and Helle, thanks a lot for participating and contributing. I want to say to those who have listened that the presentations will be made available as will the recording of this event and we are making a small summary of it all and then we hope to see you next time when we're continuing the debate.

**Anna Karlsdottir:** Thanks a lot, have a good day. Thank you, thank you, bye.
