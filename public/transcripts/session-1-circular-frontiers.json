(2) POLITICS - Nordics share ambition to be most sustainable region by 2030 on paper, but in practice addressing short-term economic concerns. Circular strategies nationally adopted but broad, non-binding, politically fragile. By contrast, EU championing circular economy with appointed Circular Commissioner marrying circularity with economics, security, geopolitical resilience.
