## Transcript

### Introduction and Welcome

**[00:10] Cathrine Barth (Moderator, Nordic Circular Hotspot):**
And now, at the end of the day, we give us the time to talk together what we heard, and what we saw, and what we learned. And together with me, on this last hour, before this sixth Nordic Circular Summit is done, I have invited Edvard Lybert Mørk, our collaborating partner in Nalek Venture, representing businesses and capital, and also Malene Val Rasmussen. You are the mayor, representing the municipality of Kujelag. And this is... Oh, you're laughing. Right. So, you are first timers on the summit, And we also have Marte Haugland, representing Nordic Innovation, that has supported this summit for the sixth year in a row. So I will just walk through the day together with you and listen out to what has been learnings and moments and how we can look ahead together. Malena, you will be more together with us tomorrow, but you have been travelling quite far, so please introduce yourself and what you represent and the place you represent.

**[00:50] Malene Vahl Rasmussen (Mayor, Kommune Kujalleq):**
Yes, thank you. My name is Malene Vell Rasmussen and I'm the mayor of Kommune Kvjellup. So that's how you say it in Greenlandic. **I'm 30 years old and I'm the youngest mayor in Greenland** and I represent the party Demokratiet. And I got elected for mayor this May, so I've only been in my role for half a year.

But what is happening in our region is very interesting around all these topics. And it's very, it was very interesting to hear what other countries had done in all the topics, and with the mineral resources, or the housing, or the global warming, or the climate, how the youth is represented in all the initiatives that we are making into our strategies, both in politics, but in the municipality or in the government.

**It's a new time for Greenland right now, because we have all the eyes are on Greenland.** And we have been approached by many countries this half-- the past half year on many interesting topics like mining, tourism, housing. How is our country ruled? And how does the different things impact our daily life? We are a small community and a big country, but not so many people. So all this attention has done a lot to the public debate, yeah.

### Malene's Key Learnings: Municipal Circular Economy

**[02:40] Einar Kleppe Holthe (Co-moderator, Nordic Circular Hotspot):**
Very good. Fantastic. And what would you bring back from what you have seen?

**[02:45] Malene Vahl Rasmussen:**
I think how we use the money in both the municipality, but also the country. How do we feed our children? How do we feed our elders? **How do we think circular economy into the way we rule the municipality but also the government? How do we get the money to stay in our region?**

Some of you may know the situation in Kumunikuyilluk. We are facing difficult times, but all the opportunities that the mining comes with and the new airport opening next year, the tourism developing in the region is very, it's gonna change the way we do business in the future and it's gonna change the way the youth are being educated or implemented in the decision making.

**Yesterday I signed an agreement with what we called Negusa in how we wanna include the children and the youth in the politic and in the municipality, how they wanna have a say in what's going to happen in the different cities.**

And I really like the thing that, I forgot your name. **Kira mentioned this morning, it's a task to unlearn how things has been done** and how we are gonna think all the value chains in the mining industry, for an example. We are having negotiation with the mining companies right now on how it's gonna impact or benefit our municipality and how is the youth, what is their wishes, how do they wanna see it impact the region, and how do they wanna be included.

And it's not just the mine, it's gonna impact all the daily life in the region, and we wanna make sure that we are included in so much of the process as we can, and we invited ourself in to negotiate how do we build up the infrastructure and what do we want to prepare in the cities to make sure that we're working together and not against each other? How can they help develop maybe more playgrounds or facilities for tourism or infrastructure to help develop the region into a better place to live?

So it all depends on each other, and I think the thing that we are talking with the local companies and the local people and the kids on how they see things is very important in our work towards a more circular economy in the region because all we see now and all the talking is very much on, oh, they're just gonna send it out of the country and the value is leaving the region. **And we wanna make sure that the value stay, most of it stays in the region.**

And how do we get out of the place where we are right now economically? I think the Greenlandic people are survivors for many, many generations, and we're not used to thinking years ahead because our ancestors are used to thinking, oh, do we have food enough for tomorrow or the next year? Or if it's gonna be a hard year, then it's somebody is going to make a sacrifice. And it's a new thing to learn, to think years ahead in thoughts of tourism or mining. It's big topics that we're not used to talk about in our daily life. So by including them and make them wanna talk to it and talk about it is very interesting. And I think there's a very good case, there's some very good cases today on how we can make that happen.

### Malene's Superpower: Cultural Preservation and Self-Sufficiency

**[07:30] Cathrine Barth:**
Thank you. That's fantastic. Thank you for sharing. And we invited earlier on, so one thing is, and I would truly live in changing times, all of us. And we asked, so what, when we follow what the changes that will happen in your municipality and region, what is your superpower? And you are carrying so much responsibility and also future on your shoulders. So what do you think we should, what do you want us to know and to listen when you have decided to be the mayor and direct the future for your region?

**[08:00] Malene Vahl Rasmussen:**
Yeah, the responsibility I have taken is very big, but the future is, I think **the future for South Greenland is very bright.** I think it's about the mentality or the way we talk about it, not, I think we are facing difficult times, but there's also so many opportunities. **Being poor makes us think different,** and I think it's a healthy time for us to rethink how we do local politics and how we use the taxpayers' money and how do we make sure that the younger generation is wanna come back to the cities or to the region or how do we make sure that the kids and the young people are included in the cultural, in the culture of South Greenland.

Because right now it's very, you can't really see our culture in our kindergartens or school systems, or vacation systems. It's very much copied from the Danish way of doing things. What we wanna do is making sure that the kids and the young people are included in how do we make sustainable solution and how do we make them learn how to be self-sufficient in the future and **making gardens for the kindergarten kids so they can learn how to grow their food and inviting hunters and fishermen to the schools and the kindergartens to show how do we cut a seal, how you make the food.**

And right now the food that we are serving in the kindergartens or the elder homes or European food, because it's cheaper, but every time we pay that food, it goes out of the region, so what we're trying to do is **making local partnerships with the hunters and the fishermen and the sheep farmers to make sure that the money stays in the municipality so it can generate more jobs, but also higher living standards and making sure that the people are not so dependent on the public sector.**

### Edvard's Key Takeaways: Headlines from Day 1

**[15:10] Cathrine Barth:**
Thank you, Marlene Waller-Asmussen. You really show and tell, I would say, the essence, essential of circular economy. And this is so much for all of us to learn. Now, you mentioned self-sufficiency, and this is where, Edvard, you opened today, sharing how **trust is the infrastructure of Greenland.** And how has your day been today?

**[15:30] Edvard Lybert Mørk (Nalek Ventures):**
I would just say things in headlines. My key takeaways today, and then some of the exciting elements I take away from today is the **side stream superfood,** without explaining anything. Yeah, very good. **Shortening supply chains as a value and strategic partnerships would be a great approach.** And then top of it all, **Inuit mindset are very aligned with circular economy way of thinking.** So that would be my key takeaways from today.

**[16:00] Edvard Lybert Mørk:**
Short and concise and clear. Very good. Very simple. He's not a politician. (laughter)

**[16:30] Cathrine Barth:**
This is why we need private-public collaboration indeed. And Marta, how was your insights? What kind of moments will you share?

### Marthe's Insights: Quality of Life and Implementation

**[17:10] Marthe Haugland (Nordic Innovation):**
Well, I think it's been a great day, absolutely. And I would like to echo Marlene here regarding the **quality of life. That is why we're doing circular economy, isn't it? Because to improve quality of life.**

And I think that today has been a little bit, I mean, we've been through several summits and today has been a little bit different. **Perhaps we've moved a little bit into implementation.** We've been planning, we've been developing tools and we've been doing, and we haven't come far enough. But we have seen concrete cases today of where value is created and where the businesses are made, and where you see that the collaboration that they've made has actually worked and is giving something back to the businesses and therefore also sustaining the circular economy. So I think that's been really good.

Other things that are very important is, of course, that you create better solutions together. And it's been really, really interesting to see the concrete Greenlandic cases today that I think that we can take away and learn a lot from. But we also hear that you have seen interesting things here that you can take back to your municipality.

And I think that **life is lived in municipalities. So that's where you need to have the solutions and the place based economy and value creation.** So I think that's very good. And it's partnerships and also this bringing people together so that we can talk and we can learn from each other is such an important part of circular economy and innovation and developing anything.

So thank you very much to Nordic Circle Hotspot for bringing us together and to giving us the opportunity to learn from each other. And also thank you to the hosts from Greenland, Nalek Ventures and Greenland.

### One Hope for the Future

**[21:00] Cathrine Barth:**
I have one question for each one of you. If there's like one hope for how to bring with us from now till next, What will be your intuition or thought, what will be what we bring along on the spirit of the Arctic, Nordic, Baltic journey?

**[21:30] Marthe Haugland:**
Well, I think **implementation and really taking ideas from here and making them reality in the municipalities where you live and the places where you live. That would be my hope.** Also that we **continue the Nordic, Baltic, Arctic collaboration,** which I think is so good for regional development.

**[22:00] Einar Kleppe Holthe:**
I would like to just build very quickly on that, on a note. This **Arctic, Nordic, Baltic regions, which define the northern part of the world, in a way, and how we need to be respectful for each other's market cultures and deep cultures and natural context and understandings.** And that is really important to take with us in the future.

And how Greenland represents the Arctic so strongly, together with the Nordic and the Baltic, and how these regions need to collaborate together, which is natural geographical regions, which has so immense market cultural learnings to each other.

So, you know, it would be interesting to see maybe to be inspired by last year's Baltic Circle Hotspot. **Maybe you should initiate the Arctic Circle Hotspot** to combine and be able to create that collaborative structure in the circular agenda and the sustainable perspective where we need to have the place-based approach, but also see the global and international connectivity that is so important and change these systems together from each our place. So that is a reflection.

**[24:00] Edvard Lybert Mørk:**
You are in a self autonomous region country. So I'm very much looking forward to see more of that in this Nordic perspective. **Looking forward to be in another self autonomous region next year.** So that's my, that's what I'm looking for.

**[24:30] Cathrine Barth:**
What would be your wish, Melanne?

**[24:40] Malene Vahl Rasmussen:**
**Action?** But we do a lot of, we attend a lot of conferences and meetings and there's a lot of visions or strategies or plans, but we are very few people in Greenland and there's very few people to actually implement all those strategies and plans.

So when we take action, it maybe takes longer time for Greenland to adapt or implement the changes, but the impact is maybe bigger than if we do it in a small community in Denmark. But so the effects is maybe more measurable -- yeah, measurable here in Greenland. So when we take action, it actually can be measured very fast on how it affects the local communities because we are so isolated.

We so, there are many small villages and it's all rural areas. **You can't compare Nuuk to Greenland, to the rest of the Greenland.** So I think maybe for the people, maybe are participating here today, **this is not all of Greenland. The real thing is on the coast. So I hope you'll visit.**

### Closing Remarks

**[26:00] Cathrine Barth:**
So you think you can expect that somebody will come and visit you pretty soon. Yeah. Oh, that's an invitation. So you can host the next session. Let's see how this is really fueling next level collaboration. Thank you so much for the insight.

I know when we spoke last week, you had a wish, you said, **I want to have a friendship municipality.** So if you have, if there are any Nordic mayors out there who would like to become a friendship municipality, especially if there are natural resources, tourism, mining, so reach out. So I guess you will be hosting quite many in time to come. We can help facilitate that. We'll make sure you have some friends.

Yeah, so thank you so much for sharing and also bringing home how **the Inuit mindset also connects with circular economy.** And thank you so much for the day together.

**[28:00] Einar Kleppe Holthe:**
Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you, Matte. And on that note, we can close the day and say thank you from Nuuk here in Greenland. It's been a fantastic day and we're looking forward to tomorrow. **It's going to be work day where we will try to implement some of these understandings and solutions in concrete projects and dialogues and conversations here in Nuuk.** Thank you so much from us.
