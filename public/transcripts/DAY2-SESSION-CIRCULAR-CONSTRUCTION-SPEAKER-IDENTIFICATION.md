   - Denmark: 80% reduction in new construction by 2030
   - Norway: 72% material use reduction by 2030
   - Amsterdam: 50% circular construction by 2030
3. **9R Framework**: Various levels of circularity from avoiding buildings to recycling materials
4. **Nordic Maturity Ranking**: Netherlands > Denmark/Finland > Sweden > Norway > Iceland > Greenland
5. **Building Less Movement**: "Bevare eller forklare" (preserve or explain) in Denmark
6. **Material Harvesting**: Transition from brute demolition to selective deconstruction
