## Overview: From Vision to Implementation

Day 2 of the Nordic Circular Summit 2025 shifted from plenary discussions to focused partner sessions, marking the transition from broad vision-setting to practical implementation. Three digital sessions brought together experts from across the Nordic-Baltic region to address specific circular economy challenges in construction, textiles, and design methodology.

**Why Partner Sessions?** While Day 1 established foundational themes—trust as infrastructure, Indigenous knowledge, place-based solutions—Day 2 operationalized these insights through sector-specific deep dives. The format enabled detailed technical discussions and the launch of new collaborative initiatives.

The day's sessions revealed a common thread: **the gap between pilot projects and scaled implementation remains the critical challenge**. As Jan Thomas Odegard framed it: "We're moving from pilots to practice—the question is how to scale circular construction across the Nordics."

## Top 3 Cross-Session Themes

### 1. Regional Collaboration as Competitive Advantage

**Appears in:** All sessions

**The Insight:** No single Nordic or Baltic country can build circular infrastructure alone. Cross-border collaboration isn't just beneficial—it's essential for achieving the scale and technology mix required for systemic change.

Kerli Kant Hvass articulated this powerfully: "No single market has scaled feedstock volumes or technology mix available to build a circular textile system alone."

This theme appeared across construction (Nordic Sustainable Construction Network), textiles (Nordic-Baltic Textile Transition Group launch), and design (Estonian toolbox shared region-wide).

**Why It Matters:** The Nordic-Baltic region represents 36 million people—large enough to achieve meaningful scale, small enough to coordinate effectively. Shared language of sustainability, similar regulatory environments, and existing trust networks create unique conditions for regional circular systems.

**Examples:**
- Nordic Circular Construction project: 16 companies collaborating across borders
- Nordic-Baltic Textile Transition Group: 8-country platform launched at summit
- Danish sector collaboration model proposed for Nordic-Baltic expansion
- Estonian Circular Design Toolbox available as open-source regional resource

### 2. Building on What Exists

**Appears in:** Construction, Textiles, Design Toolbox

**The Insight:** The most sustainable building is the one already built. The most circular textile system builds on existing sorting expertise. The most effective design process starts with understanding current state.

The construction session introduced the **Building Hierarchy Triangle**:
1. First, use what already exists
2. Prolong lifetime with maintenance and care
3. If not possible, renovate and transform
4. If more space needed, extend existing
5. Only then build new

As the Beyond Zero collaboration phrased it: "The most sustainable building is the one that is kept in use and loved."

**Why It Matters:** Circular economy isn't about creating new systems from scratch—it's about optimizing, extending, and regenerating existing assets. This applies to buildings (200,000+ unused buildings in Norwegian districts), textile infrastructure (Baltic sorting expertise), and organizational capacity (existing competencies).

**Examples:**
- Denmark's "bevare eller forklare" (preserve or explain) policy movement
- Helsinki office-to-housing conversions post-COVID
- Baltic expertise in manual sorting for reuse
- Iceland's rich material heritage (turf, pumice, scoria) as innovation foundation

### 3. Data and Trust as Enablers

**Appears in:** All sessions

**The Insight:** Circular transitions require both hard data (material flows, recycling rates, utilization metrics) and soft infrastructure (trust, pre-competitive collaboration, stakeholder relationships).

The textile session revealed a critical data gap: "We found quite fragmented—lots of reports. We don't have that consolidated, excellent overview." Meanwhile, the Danish sector collaboration demonstrated how data collection builds trust: "The data reporting exercise has been really good to prepare companies for EPR."

**Why It Matters:** Without reliable data, circular policies cannot be properly designed or evaluated. Without trust, competing companies won't collaborate on shared challenges. Both must be built simultaneously.

**Examples:**
- Iceland: No official statistics on building material imports since 2010
- Danish textile sector: 40 companies reporting annually in consistent format
- Nordic construction: No politician can state circular construction goals
- Trust-building timeline: 8 years for ACT Cluster (referenced from Day 1)

## Strategic Insights for Leaders

### Insight 1: Regulation Favors Linear—Change Requires Political Will

Jan Thomas Odegard stated bluntly: "The regulations are being challenged, but they are still very much favoring the linear way of doing things."

In construction, Norway has minimal landfilling fees, taxes that encourage demolition, and a large energy recovery sector that wants materials for incineration. In textiles, EPR fees are "unrealistically low" and targets are "missing, unclear and unambiguous."

**Strategic Implication:** Advocacy for regulatory reform must accompany business model innovation. Companies cannot wait for perfect policies but must work to change unfavorable ones.

### Insight 2: Pre-Competitive Collaboration Works

The Danish textile sector collaboration demonstrated that "competing brands that would not in a million years sit together five years ago—they're actually quite willing to sit together."

**Strategic Implication:** Create platforms for competitors to address shared challenges that are "too big for the individual business on their own." Pre-competitive frameworks enable collective learning while preserving commercial competition.

### Insight 3: Small Scale Enables Innovation

Anna Karlsdottir from Iceland noted: "Living in a small, agile society meant that experimentation felt possible. Things can happen really quickly in Iceland if the right conditions align."

Iceland's Hamkrid hempcrete project operated within regulatory loopholes (under 15 m²) because standard building permits were impossible for non-CE-marked materials. "Innovation literally operated within a loophole."

**Strategic Implication:** Use small markets and regulatory gaps as innovation laboratories. What's proven at small scale can inform larger policy frameworks.

### Insight 4: Tools Enable Action

The Estonian Circular Design Toolbox provides 15 structured tools moving companies from understanding to implementation. As Dan Mikkin emphasized: "If it adds up, it all makes sense. If it doesn't, then it's a charity project."

**Strategic Implication:** Provide practical tools, not just frameworks. Companies need step-by-step guidance from self-assessment through implementation planning.

## Conclusion: The Implementation Imperative

Day 2 of the Nordic Circular Summit 2025 demonstrated that the region has moved beyond awareness into action. The launch of the Nordic-Baltic Textile Transition Group, the Nordic Circular Construction catalog, and the open-source Circular Design Toolbox provide concrete infrastructure for systemic change.

Three key messages for decision-makers:

1. **Regional collaboration is non-negotiable.** No single country has the scale for circular infrastructure. Nordic-Baltic coordination is competitive advantage.

2. **Build on what exists.** The most circular approach starts with preserving and extending existing assets—buildings, infrastructure, knowledge, relationships.

3. **Data and trust enable everything.** Invest in both hard metrics and soft infrastructure. Neither alone is sufficient.

The sessions revealed remaining gaps: regulatory frameworks still favor linear production, data systems are fragmented, and major companies have yet to engage at scale. But the tools, networks, and knowledge now exist to address these gaps.

As Jan Thomas Odegard concluded: "We have to look back to find a way for the future. But we have to challenge the legal structures, we have to challenge the vested interest."

The Nordic-Baltic region has the trust, the expertise, and increasingly the infrastructure for circular transition. Day 2 made clear: implementation is the priority.
