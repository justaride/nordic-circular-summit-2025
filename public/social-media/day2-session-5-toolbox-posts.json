    "content": "\ud83e\ude9c Where does your organization stand on the circularity ladder?\n\nAt Nordic Circular Summit 2025, Dan Mikkin from HI Advisory introduced a powerful self-assessment framework:\n\n**The Five Levels:**\n\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 **CONVENTIONAL**\nPlay by the book. No initiative to become more circular.\n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 **GREEN**\nGood mindset, but circularity narrowed down to waste management.\n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 **SUSTAINABLE**\nCircularity as a goal, movement toward it, but not yet part of core business model. Still a sidetrack.\n\n4\ufe0f\u20e3 **RESTORATIVE**\nCircularity and sustainability as core parts of business model.\n\n5\ufe0f\u20e3 **REGENERATIVE**\nRare pioneering companies that restore the environment \u2014 giving back more than they take from nature and society.\n\n**The Honest Assessment:**\n\n\"Try to be objective. Don't imagine where you are or make yourselves any nicer than reality is.\"\n\nMost organizations overestimate their position. The value comes from honesty.\n\n**The 5-Year Question:**\n\nWhere are you today? Where do you want to be in 5 years?\n\nBe realistic. What can you actually achieve?\n\n**The Framework:**\n\nThis is from the Circular Design Toolbox \u2014 a 15-tool, open-source system developed by HI Advisory and Enterprise Estonia.\n\nPut this ladder on your wall. Everything you work on should target moving up.\n\nWhat level is your organization at today?\n\n#CircularEconomy #Sustainability #CircularDesign #BusinessModel #RegenerativeBusiness #NordicCircularSummit #DesignThinking",

(One sentence)\n\ud83d\udd39 **Users**: Who are your critical users and how will you communicate with them?\n\ud83d\udd39 **Partners**: Who helps you achieve the circular model?\n\ud83d\udd39 **Resources**: What new sourcing streams do you need?\n\ud83d\udd39 **Costs**: How much to transition?\n\ud83d\udd39 **Revenue**: What's the possible income?\n\ud83d\udd39 **Profit Timeline**: When do you break even?\n\ud83d\udd39 **Impact**: Environmental and social benefits?\n\n**The Test:**\n\nIf the financials don't work, the model won't survive. Circular economy isn't about sacrifice \u2014 it's about building businesses that create value while regenerating.\n\nThe Circular Design Toolbox is free and open-source. 15 tools covering understand, define, ideate, and develop phases.\n\nA good transition process uses 5-7 tools over several months.\n\nGet circular \u2014 but make sure it adds up.\n\n#CircularBusinessModel #Sustainability #BusinessCanvas #CircularEconomy #NordicCircularSummit #DesignThinking #Innovation",

    "content": "\ud83d\udcc9 The linear economy isn't just dominating \u2014 it's growing faster.\n\nAt Nordic Circular Summit 2025, Dan Mikkin from HI Advisory shared an uncomfortable truth:\n\n\"The linear economy is heavily dominating the world.

The goal: good lives for all within Earth's limits.\n\n**The Response:**\n\nThey created the Circular Design Toolbox \u2014 15 open-source tools to help companies transition.\n\nBased on the R Strategies framework:\n\n\u2192 **REFUSE**: Eliminate harmful materials or activities\n\u2192 **REDUCE**: If you can't refuse, minimize\n\u2192 **REPLACE**: Substitute with better alternatives\n\u2192 **EXTEND LIFECYCLE**: Repair, remanufacture, new services\n\u2192 **REGENERATE**: Give back more than you take\n\n**The Hierarchy:**\n\nRegenerative business models sit at the top \u2014 \"rare pioneering companies which actually restore the environment around them.\"\n\nBut first, you have to know where you actually stand.\n\nSelf-assessment. Value chain mapping. Stakeholder research. Ideation. Business model validation.\n\n5-7 tools. Several months. Real transformation.\n\nThe toolbox is free.
