One mission: build regional textile circularity.\n\nKey insight from Kerli Kant Hvass (Aalborg University): \"No single market has scaled feedstock volumes or technology mix available to build a circular textile system alone.\"\n\nThe Nordic-Baltic region has complementary strengths:\n- Nordics: Design, R&D, emerging sorting/recycling tech\n- Baltics: Production, manual sorting expertise, reuse/repair capacity\n\nAlone, each country struggles. Together, we have the scale and diversity for systemic change.\n\nThis is what regional collaboration looks like: not competition, but coordination.\n\n#NordicCircularSummit #TextileCircularity #NordicBaltic #RegionalCollaboration",
