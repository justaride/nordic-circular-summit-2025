Among the lowest.\n\nAt Nordic Circular Summit 2025, Jan Thomas Odegard from Natural State laid out the uncomfortable truth:\n\n**Nordic Circular Construction Maturity Ranking:**\n\n1. Netherlands (pioneer benchmark)\n2. Denmark & Finland (leading)\n3. Sweden (follows)\n4. Norway (catching up)\n5. Iceland (starting journey)\n6. Greenland (from scratch)\n\n**The 8 Main Challenges:**\n\n1. Linear domination - virgin materials still cheaper\n2. Policy limitations favoring linear business\n3. Public procurement with intentions but no action\n4. Immature, fragmented market\n5. Trust issues with circular products\n6. Low risk appetite in the sector\n7. Small reuse market with timing mismatches\n8. Slow construction cycles limiting experimentation\n\n**The Targets We Must Hit:**\n\n\u2192 Amsterdam: 50% circular construction by 2030\n\u2192 Denmark: Must reduce new construction by 80%\n\u2192 Norway: 72% material use reduction needed\n\n\"If we are to reach our sustainability goals, we really have to do changes in the way we do construction.\"\n\nThe good news? Moving together accelerates progress. If we learn from each other across Nordic borders, we can catch up to the Netherlands faster.\n\nThe question isn't whether to transform. It's whether we'll do it fast enough.\n\n#CircularConstruction #NordicCircularSummit #Sustainability #BuildingIndustry #CircularEconomy #GreenBuilding #Nordics",

Without CE marking, they found a loophole: keep structure under 15m\u00b2 and 2.5m height.\n\n\"Innovation literally operated within a loophole.\"\n\n**Key Insight:**\n\nIceland's scale makes industrial competition difficult - but gives agility and proximity for rapid systemic change.\n\n\"Circular construction here is not only a technical challenge, but a cultural and political one.\"\n\nBy reconnecting with material heritage while embracing contemporary innovation, small nations can lead the transformation.\n\n#Iceland #CircularConstruction #Hempcrete #BioBased #MaterialHeritage #NordicCircularSummit #RegenerativeFuture #BuildingMaterials",

Taking just 10% of large houses (where only 1-2 people live) and creating small flats could yield 130,000 units in both Norway and Denmark - exactly Norway's 5-year housing target!\n\n\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\udde8 ICELAND'S MATERIAL HERITAGE\nAnna Karlsdottir from Ludica Architects shared how Iceland built biodegradable structures for 900 years before concrete took over.
