# Session 5: Circular Cities & Regions
## Key Quotes and Themes

**Nordic Circular Summit 2025 | November 19, 2025 | Nuuk, Greenland**

---

## TOP 10 QUOTES

### 1. **On Trust as Foundation**
> "For the most important thing you have to build when you build places is trust. And that is what we've been talking most about today. If you don't have trust, you don't manage to create any good place. And you need to make that into the transparent structures of structure."
>
> **— Einar Kleppe Holthe**, CEO and Founder, Natural State, Norway

---

### 2. **On Economic Language**
> "The language of this structure is economy, is numbers. That is why you need to learn how to speak economic, and for instance, circular economic. You use numbers to describe values for society, for humans, with nature resource management."
>
> **— Einar Kleppe Holthe**, Natural State

---

### 3. **On Life of Place and Life of Planet**
> "The life of place, the city life, village life, neighborhood life, is also the life of our planet, is where you create or you have the activity."
>
> **— Einar Kleppe Holthe**, Natural State

---

### 4. **On Arctic Circular Wisdom**
> "The words that come to mind when people describe this new time is actually very much in line with the very, very old time in a Greenlandic or Arctic sense. How do we make use of what we have in a way that's not going to restrict future generations from doing what they need to do?"
>
> **— Inooraq Brandt**, General Manager Buildings, Rambøll Grønland A/S

---

### 5. **On Renovation Economics**
> "We have examples with housing blocks in the Disko Bay area of Greenland, where we are essentially stripping down to the main constructions of the building, refurbishing it for a new life at about half of the cost of building a new building. And given that the structural parts of a building is also where you have the largest CO2, especially when it's concrete, I think that's a thing we have to pursue more."
>
> **— Inooraq Brandt**, Rambøll Grønland

---

### 6. **On Trust-Based Strategy**
> "We must succeed together. This also includes that we're not gonna, at least for now, put in some legislation concerning sustainability. We should be able to do this together and agree on all of those things."
>
> **— Embla Kristjánsdóttir**, Head of Department for Construction, Ministry for Housing, Infrastructure and Outer Districts, Greenland

---

### 7. **On Bioregion as Social Contract**
> "A bioregion is not an administrative unit. It is a geographic and cultural space where public authorities, farmers, tourism operators, businesses and citizens agree to manage local resources sustainably based on ecological principles and shared responsibility. In essence, it's a social contract."
>
> **— Inese Suija-Markova**, Deputy Mayor, Cesis Municipality & Regional Mayor, Vidzeme Region, Latvia

---

### 8. **On Riga's Circular Vision**
> "We would like to be a modern driving force for circular economy innovations, a circular economy lab within the country and to be a source of inspiration for other cities, communities, and kind of a center for innovation in relation to circular economy."
>
> **— Tālis Linkaits**, Senior Expert and Project Manager, Riga Energy Agency, Latvia

---

### 9. **On Reused Products in LCA**
> "One of the things we found out when we made that limit was, what about reused products? What should they calculate for? And more or less everyone wanted the political push that it should be set to zero. This is not the real number. Of course, there's emissions when you also take out a product and use it directly again, but more or less zero."
>
> **— Helle Redder Momsen**, Head of Secretariat, Nordic Sustainable Construction, Denmark

---

### 10. **On Making Sustainability Easy**
> "It should not be hard to be sustainable, to make sustainable choices. It should be easy for you to do that, easy to do right."
>
> **— Helle Redder Momsen**, Nordic Sustainable Construction (quoting Tilda Larsson from Session 4)

---

## CORE THEMES

### **1. PLACE ECONOMY PRINCIPLES**

**Theory of Economic Development of Place**:
- The language is economy and numbers to describe holistic value
- Each value-creating link affects nature, human, and society
- Economic consequence of awareness drives sustainability economies
- Triangulate place + approach + topic for concrete value propositions

**Life of Place Framework**:
- Life of place = city life, village life, neighborhood life = life of planet
- Human activity on location defines economic description
- Quality of life must be defined by individuals
- Time and place together constitute experience

**Dynamic Value Creation**:
- Dynamics of place = dynamics of values in market and society
- Activity is the value of place
- Values of place are the qualities of place
- Qualities generate attractivity, which defines identity
- Identity determines quality of life

**Core Insight**:
> "You need to understand the human activity, and then the content is key. Communication and content is key, where culture is key to understand in a place-based approach with contextual and cultural understanding. If you don't bring that into the proposition, you're losing the value proposition."

### **2. RIGA'S CIRCULAR TRANSFORMATION**

**EU Mission Achievement**:
- One of 100 climate neutral and smart cities (EU mission label)
- Vision: modern driving force for circular economy innovations
- "Circular economy lab within the country"
- Source of inspiration for other cities and communities

**Eight Thematic Areas**:
- Waste management
- Renewable energy
- Mobility and transport
- Culture and business
- (Plus four additional areas)

**Three Work Directions**:

1. **Citizen Engagement**
   - Get back to basics: household separation, daily life reuse
   - Urban environments have forgotten circular practices
   - Make circularity accessible in daily life

2. **Municipality Resources**
   - Embed circularity in procurement guidelines and principles
   - Material bank for departments to share assets and inventory
   - Internal circular economy within municipal operations

3. **Circular Businesses**
   - Not funding, but moderating, stimulating, influencing
   - Networking and community building
   - Gather like-minded businesses for synergies

**Practical Examples**:
- Circular construction guidelines (used in procurement)
- Real estate transformation pre-study (using circular principles)
- Urban resource center (repair + community center, EU good practice database)
- Student design competitions for community spaces
- School circular economy competitions (2nd year)
- Library garden with circular principles (opening spring 2025)
- First Latvian Circular Economy Forum: 108 speakers, 34 sessions

**Funding Model**:
- Not from public funding primarily
- Attracting EU funds, sponsors, and grants
- Strategic resource assembly

---

### **3. CESIS BIOREGION: FIRST IN THE BALTICS**

**Context and Challenges**:
- Vidzeme region: beautiful landscape, forests, meadows, clean air
- Deep sense of community, strong cultural traditions
- But: sparse population, aging demographic, limited economic scale
- Research/innovation concentrated in capital (Riga)

**Key Learning**:
> "We cannot excel in every area being all alone. By working together small regions can achieve more than they could ever do in isolation."

**Bioregion Definition**:
- NOT an administrative unit
- Geographic and cultural space
- Public authorities, farmers, tourism operators, businesses, citizens
- Agree to manage local resources sustainably
- Based on ecological principles and shared responsibility

**Memorandum of Goodwill**:
- Crafted over one year, every word agreed by stakeholders
- 13 institutions: public, private, NGO, academic sectors
- A social contract and public commitment
- Six principles for working together
- Eight working directions/priority areas

**Eight Priority Areas**:
1. Increasing access to healthy, organic food
2. Developing short food supply chains
3. Managing natural capital through ecosystem services
4. Reducing waste
5. Accelerating energy efficiency and renewables
6. Providing sustainability education
7. Fostering authentic and nature-friendly tourism
8. (Eighth area in implementation details)

**Three Practical Examples**:

1. **Organic Food in Schools/Kindergartens**
   - Transform procurement system for local, organic ingredients
   - Replace anonymous supply chains
   - First organically certified school kitchen in Latvia (in progress)
   - Reduced emissions, healthier food, local economic value

2. **Circular Economy Center at Landfill**
   - Different concept: waste as resource
   - Developing new products from waste streams
   - Transformation not just disposal

3. **Financial Instruments & LEADER Integration**
   - Municipal grants for circular businesses
   - Integrated bioregion principles into LEADER program (EU rural funding)
   - Mainstreamed into LEADER funding strategies

**Philosophy**:
> "Strategic alliance based on shared values and really the aim to be in touch with the nature, to live in accordance with the nature, to respect the environment where we live."

---

### **4. ARCTIC CONSTRUCTION PRINCIPLES**

**Commercial Consultancy Perspective**:
- Unlike other panelists, represents commercial/consultancy role (not government)
- Rambøll Greenland - challenging public customers to push for circularity
- Through services, creating influence

**Traditional Arctic Survival Mindset**:
> "As a WIC, we can use almost anything. We essentially come from a place where how can I construct any piece of equipment or whatever in a robust way that I ensure that I'm also able to maintain? Because our survival essentially depends on it."

**Old Time vs. New Time**:
- Assumption: old time = industrialization, new time = what's ahead
- But: new time description = very, very old time in Greenlandic/Arctic sense
- Circular principles are pre-industrial Arctic practices
- "How do we make use of what we have without restricting future generations?"

**Remote Area Robust Design**:
- Often building where carpenter won't come by next week
- Important to have robust solutions
- High level of detail required
- Context varies enormously (Nuuk metropolis vs. 50-person settlement)

**Population Scale Reality**:
- Greenland: 0.00068% of world population
- Complete Arctic: 0.05% of world population
- Implication: Don't focus on innovating new high-tech materials
- Focus on utilizing applications of available materials
- Traditional practices provide insights for global circular economy

**Design for Disassembly - Personal Story**:
- Father born 1945 in small settlement
- When visiting birthplace decades later: "Where's the house?"
- Aunt's answer: "The house, we brought it."
- Traditional construction = design for disassembly
- Reusable in other settings as needs change

**Renovation Economics Example**:
- Lack of maintenance catching up now
- Positive: increased focus on maintenance, renovation, transformation
- Disko Bay housing blocks: strip to main construction, refurbish
- **About half the cost of new building**
- Structural parts = largest CO2 (especially concrete)
- Therefore: pursue renovation more

---

### **5. NORDIC SUSTAINABLE CONSTRUCTION COLLABORATION**

**2030 Vision**:
> "Within five years, the Nordic countries have this vision of being the most sustainable and integrated region in the world."

**Ministers' Declaration 2023**:
- Focus: "Recognize the potential in preserving and developing the existing building stock, and its contribution to reduced emissions"
- Political commitment to existing buildings over new construction

**2021-2024 Program**:

- Resulted in similar (not identical) regulations
- Could have been much more different

**Reused Products Policy Decision**:
- Question: What should reused products calculate for in LCA?
- Answer: More or less everyone wanted it **set to zero**
- Not real number (transport/processing has emissions)
- But provides political push and incentive
- Several countries calculate transport

**2024-2027 Continuation - Three Work Packages**:
1. **Climate/LCA** (Iceland lead): Making LCAs more efficient
2. **Circularity** (Denmark lead): Policy measures for existing buildings
3. **EU Coordination** (Sweden lead): Aligning with EU regulations

**Circularity Work Package Focus**:
- What policy measures can authorities use?
- Motivate better utilization of existing buildings

### **6. GREENLAND NATIONAL SUSTAINABILITY STRATEGY**

**Formal Approval**: 2024

**Starting Point**:
- Political ambition + clear need for shared framework
- International reality: sustainability = competitive parameter (funding access)
- Greenlandic context: unique geographic, climatic, logistical conditions
- Small industry with strong sense of community
- Lot of trust among industry members

**Trust-Based Approach (No Mandatory Legislation)**:
> "We must succeed together. This also includes that we're not gonna, at least for now, put in some legislation concerning sustainability. We should be able to do this together and agree on all of those things."

- Holistic approach across entire sector
- Reliance on collective agreement, not top-down mandates
- Community trust enables consensus

**Three Guiding Principles**:
1. Sustainability (incl. CO2 reduction) = active, permanent element of all government construction projects
2. Create healthy, high-quality buildings benefiting society and users for future generations
3. Shared understanding of sustainability established across the sector

**Purpose**:
- Launch sector-wide dialogue for future direction
- Support more sustainable development in practice
- "In practice in Greenland is sometimes a bit challenging"
- Create common foundation for entire industry to build together

**Vision**:
- Construction sector operates with consideration for future generations
- **"The needs of the present must be met without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs"**
- Must: develop sustainable/innovative solutions
- Must: contribute to growth throughout country
- Must: reflect Greenland's culture and support local communities
- Must: contribute to better climate and environment
- Must: take global responsibility and participate in global developments

"It's a very strong vision for a small industry"

**Six Goals** (intentionally limited):
1. Government (as public developer) actively contributes through holistic approach
2. Sector establishes joint forum for dialogue and cooperation
3. Develop systematic methods/tools to measure sustainability and emissions
4. Determine environmental/climate impact, set targets, reduce emissions
5. Jointly define objectives and initiatives for sustainable constructions
6. (Sixth implied in overall implementation)

> "It's not many goals, which is also our purpose. It should be goals that we can actually meet."

**Seven Concrete Initiatives**:
1. Principles for sustainability
2. Prioritization of art and architecture in government projects
3. Development of national DGNB system (certification)
4. Development of shared LCA methodology
5. Establishment of Council for Sustainability within construction sector
6. Preparation of CO2 emissions action plan
7. (Seventh related to monitoring/communication)

**Implementation Progress**:
- **DGNB system**: Well underway, December conference for final dialogue
- **Government approach**: Will use DGNB standard but NOT get certification
  - "It doesn't really give anything of value to us"
  - But needs to be in place for private projects
- **LCA methodology**: December presentation
- **Council for Sustainability**: Established 2023, held two meetings
  - Main discussion: how to get to CO2 action plan
  - **Challenge: "We don't have any data at the moment"**
  - Need to start somewhere, building baseline

### **7. RETROFIT FIRST ECONOMICS**

**London Regulatory Model**:
- 2020: Requirement to retrofit buildings first
- Completely changed city development scene
- Regulatory approach makes renovation default

**Oslo Transformation Projects**:
- Circular economy drives biggest sustainability city projects
- Office → elderly home: "one of best practices in real estate development"
- Keep resources + create societal relevance
- Old factories → vibrant communities
- Rural abandoned factories → travel, leisure, innovation, production hubs
- Small municipality (1,700 people) elderly home transformation

**Economic Transformation Effect**:
> "When you transform the buildings and fill it with the new life, storage to life, you get a completely different economic perspective, and you increase the value of the property."

**Outcomes of Good Place Development**:
- Maintain nature value
- Take care of human value
- Create societal value

**Riga's Systematic Approach**:
- Pre-study before transformation
- Using all circularity principles
- Using all available materials within building
- Subsequent procurement based on circular criteria

**Greenland's 50% Cost Savings**:
- Disko Bay housing blocks
- Strip to main construction
- Refurbish for new life
- **About half the cost of building new**
- Structural parts = largest CO2 (especially concrete)
- Keeping structure dramatically reduces emissions

**Nordic Ministers' Recognition**:
- 2023 declaration emphasizes existing building stock potential
- Contribution to reduced emissions
- High-level political backing

**Compounding Benefits**:
- Economic: 50% cost savings
- Environmental: Dramatically lower CO2
- Social: Neighborhood character maintained
- Cultural: Architectural heritage preserved
- Speed: Often faster than new construction
- Risk: Lower uncertainty

### **8. CIRCULAR PROCUREMENT LEVERAGE**

**Riga's Multi-Faceted Approach**:

1. **Circular Construction Guidelines**
   - Developed with construction community
   - Embedded in procurement practices
   - Circular requirements from the start

2. **Material Banks**
   - Municipality departments share assets/inventory
   - Internal circular economy
   - Reduces redundant purchasing

3. **Real Estate Transformation Procurement**
   - Pre-study informs actual procurement
   - Circular principles embedded
   - Available materials maximized

4. **Urban Resource Center**
   - Circular design from beginning
   - EU good practice database case
   - Repair + community center model

**Cesis's Organic Food Procurement**:
- Transform school/kindergarten procurement
- Local, organic ingredients prioritized
- Replace anonymous supply chains
- Reduce emissions, healthier food, local value retention
- First organically certified school kitchen (Latvia) in progress

**Essential Role of Circular Criteria in Tenders**:
- Not nice-to-have add-on
- Structural requirement
- Shapes what suppliers offer

**Why Procurement Matters**:
1. Creates demand justifying supplier investment
2. Sets standards private sector follows
3. Demonstrates feasibility at scale
4. Builds circular supply chains
5. Establishes viable price benchmarks

**The Procurement Muscle**:
- Municipalities and governments hold enormous market power
- Strategic use shapes markets
- Not just purchasing - market shaping

---

### **9. URBAN-RURAL VALUE SYMBIOSIS**

**Urban Learning from Rural**:
- Cesis bioregion: memorandum of goodwill model adaptable to urban
- Integration with existing funding (LEADER)
- Short food supply chains and local production
- Stakeholder-driven, place-based approach

- Arctic practices: robust design, design for disassembly, maintenance-first
- Relevant as craftspeople become scarcer in cities
- Supply chains more fragile everywhere

**Rural Learning from Urban**:
- Riga's urban resource centers: repair + community model works in villages
- Digital Product Passports and LCA at city scale
- Create transparency benefiting rural producers
- Lower transport emissions become visible and valued

- Circular procurement guidelines from cities
- Adaptable by smaller municipalities with less capacity

**Bidirectional Knowledge Flows**:
- **Urban → Rural**: Infrastructure standards, digital systems, regulatory frameworks, market access
- **Rural → Urban**: Traditional knowledge, place-based practices, community trust, ecosystem awareness
- Neither superior, both necessary

**Scale-Appropriate Applications**:
- Riga: material bank at city scale with multiple departments
- Cesis: bioregion at regional scale across four municipalities
- Greenland: 38 outposts, sometimes "three people and a freezer" at settlement scale
- Principles consistent, implementation varies by place/population/infrastructure

**Locally-Rooted-Globally-Connected**:
- Royal Greenland's 38 outposts example
- "Even the smallest settlements have global market reach"
- Not local OR global, but both integrated
- Small communities maintain lifeways + participate in global value chains
- Cities maintain innovation capacity + learn from rural wisdom

---

### **10. TRUST AND COMMUNITY AS FOUNDATION**

**Holthe's Core Principle**:
> "For the most important thing you have to build when you build places is trust. If you don't have trust, you don't manage to create any good place. And you need to make that into the transparent structures of structure."

**Greenland's Trust-Based Strategy**:
- No mandatory legislation (yet)
- Collective agreement through community trust
- "We should be able to do this together"
- Strong sense of community in small industry
- Trust between all working in industry

**Cesis's Memorandum of Goodwill**:
- One year to craft, every word agreed
- 13 diverse institutions sign on voluntarily
- Social contract, not regulatory requirement
- Public commitment to create cleaner, healthier, circular region

**Riga's Moderator Role**:
- Not funding, but stimulating and influencing
- Build trust through networking
- Convener and catalyst, not controller

**Why Trust Matters**:
- Enables risk-taking
- Facilitates experimentation
- Encourages knowledge-sharing
- Supports collaboration
- All essential for circular transitions

**Communication and Culture**:
> "Communication and content is key, where culture is key to understand in a place-based approach with contextual and cultural understanding. If you don't bring that into the proposition, you're losing the value proposition." — Einar Kleppe Holthe

- Cookie-cutter programs fail without cultural respect
- Context and communication in locally meaningful ways
- Culture shapes behavior more than regulation

**Sense of Belonging**:
- Quality and flexibility of proposition
- Relevance of meaning and place
- Long-term sustainable value proposition
- Accessibility and transparency of market dynamics
- Sense of belonging and trust = must build these

**Leverage Your Procurement Power**:
1. Embed circular criteria in all procurement documents
2. Create internal material banks for asset sharing between departments
3. Develop circular construction guidelines with construction community
4. Make procurement transparent and educational

**Start with Citizens**:
1. Urban environments have forgotten circular practices—reconnect people to basics
2. Create urban resource centers: repair + community center model
3. Involve youth and students through competitions
4. Measure and communicate progress to inspire action

**Use Pre-Studies**:
1. Before major transformations, conduct circular pre-studies
2. Document available materials within existing buildings
3. Use pre-studies to inform procurement for actual reconstruction
4. Share learnings as good practice cases

### For Regional Governments:

**Bioregion Model Lessons**:
1. Not an administrative unit—voluntary agreement among stakeholders
2. Memorandum of goodwill: craft carefully over time with all voices
3. Integrate with existing funding mechanisms (e.g., LEADER, EU funds)
4. Focus on short supply chains and local organic production
5. Treat waste as resource, not disposal problem

**Small Regions Can Lead**:
1. Cannot excel in every area alone—prioritize and cooperate
2. International cooperation builds capacity
3. Rural challenges (aging, sparse population, limited scale) = innovation drivers
4. Strategic alliance based on shared values, not top-down mandates

### For National Governments:

**Trust-Based Strategy (Greenland Model)**:
1. Consider collective agreement over mandatory legislation where appropriate
2. Leverage strong sense of community and industry trust
3. Shared framework + political ambition without immediate regulation
4. Create forums for dialogue and cooperation (e.g., Council for Sustainability)
5. Start building data before setting targets

**Be Realistic About Challenges**:
1. May not have data initially—start somewhere, build baseline
2. "In practice is sometimes challenging"—acknowledge context
3. Set achievable goals, not overwhelming lists
4. Vision can be strong even for small industry

### For Construction Sector:

**Renovation as Opportunity**:
1. 50% cost savings compared to new construction (Greenland data)
2. Structural parts = largest CO2 (especially concrete)
3. Strip to main construction, refurbish for new life
4. Catch up on maintenance before considering new builds

**Arctic Design Principles**:
1. Robust solutions for limited maintenance access
2. High level of detail in what you're doing
3. Design for disassembly—traditional practice becoming modern necessity
4. Focus on applications of available materials, not high-tech innovation
5. Make use of what we have without restricting future generations

**LCA Preparation**:
1. Calculate climate impact across all phases (mandatory trend spreading)
2. Reused products set to zero or near-zero in many systems
3. Transparent supply chains = easier compliance
4. Local/regional production = competitive advantage for DPP and LCA

### For Cross-Border Collaboration:

**Nordic-Baltic Model**:
1. Harmonize approaches while respecting national differences
2. Create common knowledge base before regulations
3. Share policy measures catalogues for inspiration
4. Hold regular forums (e.g., Nordic Climate Forum for Construction)
5. Educational programs in multiple languages, freely available
6. Three work packages model: climate/LCA, circularity, EU coordination

**Urban-Rural Knowledge Flows**:
1. Bidirectional: urban → rural AND rural → urban
2. Scale-appropriate applications, not one-size-fits-all
3. Locally-rooted-globally-connected, not local OR global
4. Infrastructure standards + traditional knowledge
5. Digital systems + place-based practices

### For All Practitioners:

**Build on Trust**:
> "If you don't have trust, you don't manage to create any good place."
- Make trust transparent in structures
- Communication and culture are key
- Contextual and cultural understanding essential
- Sense of belonging and transparency of market dynamics
- Long-term value proposition and collaboration

**Economic Language**:
> "The language of this structure is economy, is numbers."
- Learn to speak circular economic
- Use numbers to describe values: society, humans, nature, market
- Economic consequence of awareness drives change
- Triangulate: place + approach + topic = concrete value proposition

**Place as Practice**:
- Life of place = life of planet
- Human activity on location = economic description
- Quality of life defined by individuals in context of place
- Values of place → qualities of place → attractivity → identity → quality of life
- Content is key; culture shapes behavior more than regulation

## GLOBAL RELEVANCE

### Principles Transferable Globally:

**Economic Integration of Multiple Values**:
- Not just capital value, but nature, human, societal, market values together
- Numbers can and must describe holistic value
- Economic viability + environmental responsibility + social benefit

**Trust Enables Experimentation**:
- Community trust can replace (or supplement) mandatory legislation
- Small groups with strong trust can move faster than large bureaucracies
- Social contracts and memorandums work where relationships are strong

**Renovation as Economic Opportunity**:
- 50% cost savings proven in Arctic conditions
- If it works there, it works anywhere
- Structural reuse = massive CO2 savings
- Policy can shift default from demolition to renovation

**Place-Based Adaptation**:
- No universal blueprint for circular cities
- Context (geographic, climatic, cultural, logistical) determines approach
- Scale-appropriate solutions from 50-person settlements to capital cities
- Traditional knowledge + contemporary systems

**Procurement as Market Shaping**:
- Public procurement = enormous leverage
- Circular criteria drive supplier innovation
- Creates demand, sets standards, demonstrates feasibility
- Material banks, pre-studies, guidelines all accessible to any municipality

### Regional Collaboration Value:

**No Single Country Can Solve This**:
- Even Nordic countries with advanced capacities collaborate
- Harmonize regulations while respecting differences
- Share knowledge, catalogues, educational programs
- Combined voice stronger in global/EU negotiations

**Urban-Rural Interdependence**:
- Cities need rural ecosystem services, food, resources
- Rural areas need urban markets, infrastructure, innovation
- Symbiosis > competition
- Both have knowledge the other needs

### The Meta-Lesson:

**Circular cities emerge from place-based approaches that honor local context, traditional knowledge, and community trust while connecting to regional, national, and global systems.**

Not mandates alone.
Not universal blueprints.
Not centralized solutions.

But: place economy thinking + practical implementation + community trust + cultural respect + economic viability + knowledge sharing + robust design + circular procurement + adaptive reuse + traditional wisdom + contemporary innovation.

From place to planet, one project at a time.
