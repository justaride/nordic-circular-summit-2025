## Powerful Quotes

### Dan Mikkin (Partner & Sustainability Designer, HI Advisory)

> "The linear economy is heavily dominating the world. And it's not moving in the right direction. We have just the recent data coming in and it's getting worse. Not that we are having less circular solutions, but the linear economy is growing even faster."

> "Regenerative organizations are these rare pioneering companies which actually restore the environment around them so that they give back more than they take from nature and from society."

> "If it adds up, then it all makes sense. If it doesn't, then it's a charity project. We are talking about actual working business models."

> "The most difficult part is usually taking the first step. What would we do in the first 100 days? Critical to get your transition started."

> "A good efficient transition process usually takes five, six, seven tools over a course of several months."

> "What can we give back to the environment as companies, as users of products and services?"

### Maarja Karlson (Partner & Sustainability Designer, HI Advisory)

> "We wanted to create this step-by-step systemic approach that the process would be a bit easier."

> "The aim here is not to score the highest but to be as objective as you can, be realistic."

> "What is especially important with circular collaborations are the partners. You want to understand their needs and challenges as well."

> "It can be a small thing - replace some chemicals, change packaging, or offer products as a service where people lease instead of own."

## Key Frameworks

### The Double Diamond Process

| Phase | Purpose | Tools Count |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| **Understand** | Map situation, stakeholders, inefficiencies | 6 tools |
| **Define** | Narrow to new value proposition | 3 tools |
| **Ideate** | Generate and prioritize solutions | 3 tools |
| **Develop** | Create implementation roadmap | 3 tools |

### The Circularity Ladder

| Level | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **1. Conventional** | Play by the book, no circularity initiative |
| **2. Green** | Good mindset, circularity = waste management |
| **3. Sustainable** | Circularity as goal, but not core to business |
| **4. Restorative** | Circularity as core business model component |
| **5. Regenerative** | Give back more than take from nature/society |

### Five Key R Strategies for Ideation

1. **REFUSE** - Eliminate harmful materials or activities
2. **REDUCE** - Minimize if refusing isn't possible
3. **REPLACE** - Substitute harmful with beneficial
4. **EXTEND LIFECYCLE** - Repair, remanufacture, offer as service
5. **REGENERATE** - Restore environment through products/services

## Central Themes

### 1. Practical Over Theoretical
The toolbox provides step-by-step guidance, worksheets, and examples to make circular transformation actionable. "We wanted to create this step-by-step systemic approach that the process would be a bit easier."

### 2. Business Viability is Non-Negotiable
Environmental goals must align with financial sustainability. "If it doesn't add up, then it's a charity project. We are talking about actual working business models."

### 3. Partners Matter as Much as Users
Circular collaborations require deep understanding of suppliers, investors, and stakeholders—not just end users. Partner personas reveal opportunities for joint circular innovation.

### 4. Honest Self-Assessment
Progress requires honest baseline measurement. Don't overestimate current position or underestimate transformation difficulty. "Be as objective as you can, be realistic."

### 5. First Steps First
The 100 Days Implementation Plan addresses the hardest part: starting. Transformation happens through immediate action, not just planning.

- Difficulty level
- Additional resources
- Worksheets
- Tips and examples

---

## Circular Business Model Canvas

**Center**: Value proposition + Business value goal

**Left Side** (Users):
- Critical users/participants
- Communication channels
- Insight gathering methods

**Right Side** (Partners):
- Critical partners
- Required actions
- Resource streams

**Bottom** (Financial):
- Transition costs
- Possible revenue
- Profit timeline

**Outer Layer** (Impact):
- Environmental/social impacts
- Regenerative goals

---

## Value Chain Mapping

### Seven Stages Assessed
1. Design
2. Materials sourcing
3. Manufacturing
4. Distribution
5. Marketing
6. Sales
7. End of life

### For Each Stage, Map:
- Required resources
- Critical stakeholders
- Inefficiencies
- Macro-level influences (EU regulations, industry standards)

---

## Key Insights

### Economic Goals of Circular Design
1. **Economic gains** - efficiency in material use
2. **Risk management** - regulatory compliance, reduced dependency
3. **Competitive advantage** - clear targeting, substantive brand value

### Practical Guidance
- Not all 15 tools needed—5-7 tools typical for efficient transition
- Tools can be used digitally (Miro) or printed for workshops
- Self-guided use possible; expert facilitation helpful for complex tools
- AI integration planned for future versions

## Background Context

### Planetary Boundaries Crossed
- Ocean acidification now exceeds ocean's repair capacity (2025)
- Linear economy growing faster than circular solutions can scale

### Donut Economics Vision
Human needs met within planetary boundaries—the "sweet spot" companies should target

### R Strategies Foundation
Based on Ellen MacArthur Foundation's 10 R's framework:
Refuse, Rethink, Reduce, Reuse, Repair, Refurbish, Remanufacture, Repurpose, Recycle, Regenerate
