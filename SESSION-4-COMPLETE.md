## 🌟 HIGHLIGHTS & LEARNINGS

### Most Impactful Quotes

**"In Greenland, circularity isn't a trend, it's a tradition and it's the foundation."**
- Frederik Thrane
- Core reframing of circular economy as ancient wisdom, not modern innovation

**"We hunt for the meat. And then we wear the rest."**
- Mia Chemnitz
- Perfect encapsulation of waste-as-foundation business model

**"Your scarf is not just a scarf. It's a bit of a history, a culture, and tradition. And a meal."**
- Lise Lotte
- Captures the complete integration of knowledge, materials, and community

**"We don't have to reinvent the wheel. We have to listen and learn from the history."**
- Kristian Ottesen
- Humility in circular transformation—reintroducing what was forgotten

**"We do have two ears and one mouth, so I really would like that we listen. While we share, we listen as well."**
- Lise Lotte
- Essential discipline for circular economy: listening at least twice as much as speaking

### Most Important Themes

1. **Cultural Paradigm Shift**: Individualism → Collectivism required for circular economy
2. **Traditional Knowledge**: Millennia of practice ≥ academic proof
3. **Quota as Feature**: Scarcity drives high value, sustainability, and zero waste
4. **Maker = Repairer**: What ESPR tries to mandate, local relationships make natural
5. **Decolonization**: Reclaiming traditional materials = circular economy

### Business Model Innovations

**Grevilliot**:
- Founded on "waste product" (sealskin from meat harvest)
- Limited by sustainable quotas (always sold out)
- Complete traceability (every product, every maker known)
- No scaling beyond ecological limits
- Local value retention prioritized

**Royal Greenland**:
- 38 outposts = sole employer in smallest settlements
- Reintroducing circular practices abandoned during industrialization
- Cultural embeddedness ("waste not, have not, want not")
- Side streams becoming revenue streams

**Ludwig Svensson**:
- 137 years, full in-house production
- DPP advantage: "receive information very easy and very quick"
- Local manufacturing = easier compliance

### Policy & Systems Insights

**Digital Product Passport**:
- Mandatory for EU market access by 2030
- "Not having control is expensive"
- Transparent supply chains = easier compliance
- Local manufacturing = competitive advantage
- Compliance becomes market access barrier for opaque chains

**Nordic-Baltic Collaboration**:
- "Not one country can figure out the textile circular system"
- Nordics consume, Baltics receive used textiles
- Regional collaboration necessity
- Vision: Most sustainable region by 2030
