You are the mayor, representing the municipality of Kujelag. And this is... Oh, you're laughing. Right. So, you are first timers on the summit, And we also have Marte Haugland, representing Nordic Innovation, that has supported this summit for the sixth year in a row. So I will just walk through the day together with you and listen out to what has been learnings and moments and how we can look ahead together.

But what is happening in our region is very interesting around all these topics. And it's very, it was very interesting to hear what other countries had done in all the topics, and with the mineral resources, or the housing, or the global warming, or the climate, how the youth is represented in all the initiatives that we are making into our strategies, both in politics, but in the municipality or in the government. It's a new time for Greenland right now, because we have-- all the eyes are on Greenland. And we have been approached by many countries this half-- the past half year on many interesting topics like mining, tourism, housing. How is our country ruled? And how does the different things impact our daily life? We are a small community and a big country, but not so many people. So all this, what was it?

How do we think circular economy into the way we rule the municipality but also the government? How do we get the money to stay in our region? Some of you may know the situation in Kumunikuyilluk. We are facing difficult times, but all the opportunities that the mining comes with and the new airport opening next year, the tourism developing in the region is very, it's gonna change the way we do business in the future and it's gonna change the way the youth are being educated or implemented in the, what's it called? (speaking in foreign language) Decision making. Yesterday I signed an agreement with what we called Negusa in how we wanna include the children and the youth in the politic and in the municipality, how they wanna have a say in what's going to happen in the different cities. And I really like the thing that, I forgot your name. Kira mentioned this morning, it's a task to unlearn how things has been done and how we are gonna think all the value chains in the mining industry, for an example. We are having negotiation with the mining companies right now on how it's gonna impact or benefit our municipality and how is the youth, what is their wishes, how do they wanna see it impact the region, and how do they wanna be included. And it's not just the mine, it's gonna impact all the daily life in the region, and we wanna make sure that we are included in so much of the process as we can, and we invited ourself in to negotiate how do we build up the infrastructure and what do we want to prepare in the cities to make sure that we're working together and not against each other? How can they help develop maybe more playgrounds or facilities for tourism or infrastructure to help develop the region into a better place to live? So it all depends on each other, and I think the thing that we are talking with the local companies and the local people and the kids on how they see things is very important in our work towards a more circular economy in the region because all we see now and all the talking is very much on, oh, they're just gonna send it out of the country and the value is leaving the region. And we wanna make sure that the value stay, most of it stays in the region. And how do we get out of the place where we are right now economically? I think the Greenlandic people are survivors for many, many generations, and we're not used to thinking years ahead because our ancestors are used to thinking, oh, do we have food enough for tomorrow or the next year? Or if it's gonna be a hard year, then it's somebody is going to make a sacrifice. And it's a new thing to learn, to think years ahead in thoughts of tourism or mining. It's big topics that we're not used to talk about in our daily life. So by including them and make them wanna talk to it and talk about it is very interesting. And I think there's a very good case, there's some very good cases today on how we can make that happen.",

It's very much copied from the Danish way of doing things. What we wanna do is making sure that the kids and the young people are included in how do we make sustainable solution and how do we make them learn how to be self-sufficient in the future and making gardens for the kindergarten kids so they can learn how to grow their food and inviting hunters and fishermen to the schools and the kindergartens to show how do we cut a seal, how you make the food. And right now the food that we are serving in the kindergartens or the elder homes or European food, because it's cheaper, but every time we pay that food, it goes out of the region, so what we're trying to do is making local partnerships with the hunters and the fishermen and the sheep farmers to make sure that the money stays in the municipality so it can generate more jobs, but also higher living standards and making sure that the people are not so dependent on the public sector.",

Because to improve quality of life. And I think that today has been a little bit, I mean, we've been through several summits and today has been a little bit different. Perhaps we've moved a little bit into implementation. We've been planning, we've been developing tools and we've been doing, and we haven't come far enough. But we have seen concrete cases today of where value is created and where the businesses are made, and where you see that the collaboration that they've made has actually worked and is giving something back to the businesses and therefore also sustaining the circular economy. So I think that's been really good. Other things that are very important is, of course, that you create better solutions together. And it's been really, really interesting to see the concrete Greenlandic cases today that I think that we can take away and learn a lot from. But we also hear that you have seen interesting things here that you can take back to your municipality. And I think that life is lived in municipalities. So that's where you need to have the solutions and the place based economy and value creation. So I think that's very good. And and it's partnerships and also this bringing people together so that we can talk and we can learn from each other is such an important part of circular economy and innovation and developing anything. So thank you very much to Nordic Circle Hotspot for bringing us together and to giving us the opportunity to learn from each other.
