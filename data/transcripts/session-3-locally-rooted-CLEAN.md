## Part 1: Introduction & Session Overview
**Time**: 12:45 - 12:48 (3 minutes)
**Speaker**: Alisa Mick

### Introduction

**Alisa Mick**: Welcome, everyone, to the Locally Rooted Session. I'm Alisa Mick, and I'm the founder of Miksi. We're located in Helsinki. We're focused on circular economy and innovation.

This session couldn't take place in a more fitting place than here in the Arctic region, and especially in Greenland, where the realities of climate change are unfolding faster than almost anywhere else on Earth. At the same time, local communities in the Arctic region are directly affected. Their ways of life and livelihoods are changing.

This is also the home to critical resources that are essential for industrial supply chains, essential for resilient Nordic economy. This dual reality captures the essence of this session: how economic ambitions can and must be matched with coordinated approaches to climate security, to emerging risks, and to long-term resilience in a rapidly changing Arctic region. And of course, we are going to discuss what is the role of the circular economy in this reality.

This session is called Locally Rooted for a reason. Resilience begins here with self-sufficiency, local sustainable supply chains, but also with a very strong collaboration and connections to other regions in Europe and beyond.

This session will kick off with a keynote by Mika Sulkinoja, senior lead at Sitra. Then we'll have a panel discussion, moderated by myself and by Keira Dignan, the Secretary General of Regeneration 2030. Then we'll have a panel that will feature Patrick Schroeder, Senior Research Fellow at Chatham House; Luca De Lorenzo, the Vice President, Head of Sustainability and Mandate at the Nordic Investment Bank; and Anders Ladefoged, a member of the European Economic and Social Committee. And we'll close the session with reflections from Cathrine Barth, the head of circular economy at Natural State, and Keira Dignan.

So we have a lot to do. We have only 45 minutes. And I would like to start with Mika Sulkinoja, who will join us from Finland. Mika Sulkinoja is a senior lead at Sitra, the Finnish Innovation Fund. He's driving international cooperation on circular economy, climate and nature-related initiatives. He leads global projects such as the World Circular Economy Forum and also new initiatives that we'll hear about now. Welcome Mika from Helsinki.

## Part 2: Keynote - Building Resilience Through Circularity
**Time**: 12:48 - 13:00 (12 minutes)
**Speaker**: Mika Sulkinoja

### How Do We Build Resilience in a World That Relies on Global Value Chains?

**Mika Sulkinoja**: Thank you, Alisa. And hello everyone and greetings from a sort of snowy Helsinki. Just a tiny bit of snow on ground.

Indeed, my name is Mika and I serve as the World Circular Economy Coordinator at Sitra, as Alisa mentioned. Today I want to explore a question which Alisa a little bit explained already. **How do we build resilience in a world that relies on global value chains?**

So few issues illustrate this better than the accelerating race for critical energy transition minerals, materials that make electrification, digital infrastructure and clean energy systems possible. And we're actually witnessing a historic shift. Demand for these transition minerals is growing rapidly and market signals point to tightening supply in the years ahead.

Export restrictions are increasing, especially for rare earth metals, cobalt, lithium and graphite. China's export controls on graphite last year showed how quickly supply chains can tighten and how exposed Europe and other continents are.

At the same time, Europe lacks full visibility. For many critical minerals, there are no dedicated trade codes to track recycled or secondary flows. This is clearly a strategic blind spot.

### The EU Critical Raw Materials Act

The EU Critical Raw Materials Act sets ambitious 2030 targets:
- **10% extraction**
- **40% processing**
- **25% recycling**

But here is the paradox. Europe continues to export the materials it needs most. A clear example is black mass, the metal-rich fraction from crushed lithium-ion batteries. It contains lithium, cobalt, nickel and manganese. Keeping this value in Europe would be essential for meeting recycling targets and reducing external dependency.

**Circularity is therefore clearly no longer an environmental agenda. It is now a matter of competitiveness and security for Europe and for all other regions as well.**

### Mining and Circularity: Both Are Needed

One thing is clear, **we cannot mine our way out of this dependency**. Circularity must carry a growing share of our future material needs. But at the same time, we will still need mining in the years ahead. Mining remains essential for meeting near-term demand for batteries, renewables, infrastructure and clean technologies.

So the real question is not whether we mine, but how we combine responsible mining with circularity, substitution and much longer product lifetimes.

If we rely on mining alone, we stay vulnerable. And if we rely on circularity alone, we cannot scale fast enough. **We need both. But circularity must define the long-term path.**

In Europe, leading recyclers already demonstrate high recovery rates for cobalt, nickel, copper and manganese, and also rapidly improving recovery for lithium. The Nordic region possesses many promising innovations from sodium ion technologies to bio-based anodes to new methods of recovering metals from tailings.

But innovation needs supportive rules. This is why Sitra welcomes the forthcoming **Circular Economy Act** under the EU's Clean Industrial Deal - a coherent single market for secondary materials and remanufactured products.

### Inner Loops: The Strongest Economic Benefits

Recycling is essential, but it is really the last loop of circularity. **The strongest economic and social benefits come from the inner loops: reuse, repair, refurbishment and re-manufacturing.**

And underpinning these inner loops is the **Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation (ESPR)**, which sets horizontal requirements for durability, repairability, upgradability and recyclability, and the digital product passport across a wide range of product groups. It is one of the most important upstream measures Europe has ever introduced.

The Act combined with ESPR must go really beyond a narrow focus on material efficiency. To truly unlock potential of these inner loops, it needs to address remanufacturing, refurbishment, reuse markets and other measures that extend product lifetimes. Without this broader scope, Europe risks missing the largest circularity gains, both in value retention and resilience.

According to the European Commission's Competitiveness Compass, **Europe's remanufacturing market could go from 31 billion euros today to around 100 billion euros by 2030, creating up to half a million jobs**. Longer product lifetimes mean stronger resilience.

### Global Collaboration: EU CERC

Material flows cross borders, ecosystems and political systems. They pass through biodiversity hotspots, indigenous territories and economies where informal workers are essential. Because these value chains are so interconnected, no country or region can build circularity alone.

This is exactly why the **EU Circular Economy Resource Centre (EU CERC)** was established earlier this year by the European Commission and the Finnish Ministry for Foreign Affairs. And it is implemented by us, Sitra, together with Enabel from Belgium.

The EU CERC works on three fronts:
1. **Policy lab** - focusing on circular roadmaps and governance issues
2. **Business lab** - for SMEs and investment ecosystems
3. **Knowledge lab** - for peer learning and expertise sharing

A key priority for the CERC is strengthening critical material partnerships between the EU and partner countries, really supporting circular investment, technological cooperation and secure sustainable supply.

And through the World Circular Economy Forum, Sitra brings together global partners to advance circular solutions across value chains, keeping both policy dialogue and innovation truly international. Europe cannot and should not transition alone.

### The India Forum: Shifting to Upstream Solutions

With the forum this year in Brazil that is behind us, our focus is now shifting to India, where the next forum will be held. Discussions with our Indian partners point clearly toward a shift from narrow focus on recycling to a broader embrace of upstream solutions, also in India, and forward-looking policy frameworks.

Emerging themes at the Indian Forum include:
- Circular solutions and business models in major manufacturing clusters of India, such as textiles, ICT and automotive industries
- AI and data and digital infrastructure for circularity
- Resource security, especially in critical minerals
- Integrating informal workers into fair and circular value chains

This aligns closely with Europe's biggest gap today: the inner loops of circularity. Next forum will be a pivotal moment for shaping global progress on upstream circular solutions.

### Locally Rooted and Globally Connected

But back to the topic of this session: locally rooted and globally connected. Circularity actually offers tools for both.

It strengthens **local resilience** through:
- Longer product lifetimes
- Repair and reuse
- Regional production networks
- Value that stays closer to our communities

And at the same time it helps us manage **global interdependence** more wisely through:
- Transparent value chains
- Fair partnerships
- Policies that align local needs with broader European and international transitions

**The Nordics have a strong foundation for this.** A tradition of trust, experience with local-global cooperation, and industries that increasingly look at full value chains, not just individual segments.

With the forthcoming Circular Economy Act, with ESPR raising the bar for product design, and with EU CERC strengthening partnerships abroad, and with India beginning upstream solutions bringing the upstream solutions to the centre of next forum, we now have a chance to connect these scales more effectively - from communities and regions to European frameworks and global collaboration.

Not to create perfect self-sufficiency, but systems that are more resilient, more regenerative and more aligned with the places where we live and work. Thank you very much for this opportunity.

**Alisa Mick**: Thank you very much, Mika. We are looking forward to see what the Centre, of course, will do in the near future, and looking forward to the World Circular Economy Forum in India. Thank you very much.

**Mika Sulkinoja**: Thank you.

## Part 3: Panel Discussion - Balancing Ambitions, Finance, and Rights
**Time**: 13:00 - 13:26 (26 minutes)
**Moderators**: Alisa Mick, Keira Dignan
**Panelists**: Anders Ladefoged, Luca De Lorenzo, Patrick Schroeder

### Question 1: Balancing EU Goals - Is It Possible?

**Alisa Mick**: OK, great. So now we are going to start our panel. But first I would like to invite Keira Dignan, my co-moderator to this panel. And then please, our panelists, join us here. So, we have Anders Ladefoged, the member of the European Economic and Social Committee. Patrick Schroeder is the Senior Research Fellow at Chatham House and Luca De Lorenzo is the Vice President at the Nordic Investment Bank. So please have the mics.

I'll start with you Anders. So as we heard also from Mika, the EU has very ambitious goals: cutting emissions by at least 55% by 2030, achieving climate neutrality by 2050, then of course there is also the Critical Raw Materials Act that adds another layer with the ambitions for 10% of strategic materials to be extracted, 40% processed, and 25% recycled within the EU. At the same time, there are also the goals of boosting Europe's competitiveness through initiatives like the Green Deal Industrial Plan. So **how do you balance all these different goals? Is it possible? And what is the EU doing in order to do it?**

**Anders Ladefoged**: Well, thank you very much for this easy question. Can you hear me? Yes, good. And thank you for having me on the panel. I'm glad to be able to represent also an European institution, namely the European Economic and Social Committee, which is an advisory body to the EU. And we have also been working on Arctic policy from a civil society perspective recently, and also very much with circular economy through our stakeholder platform.

But your question, how can we, from a, let's say, European policy perspective, balance all these goals, is it possible, and so on? Well, I would say that is really a very political question, and I think you will get different answers depending on who you ask.

I mean, there are many countries in Europe and also industrial sectors who say, no, it's too much. They look at many of the commission's initiatives as something that will drive up costs and hurt their competitiveness. So in a way, we need to, from a Nordic perspective, to think how we deal with this.

And I think maybe to answer your question, you need to turn it upside down and think, what do we think about all the initiatives from the commission? And we just heard Mika say something about it. I won't repeat that, and also in your question, all these initiatives are very good. It's good ambitions. And I think they've aligned well with the level of ambitions that we have in the Nordic countries.

But the problem is obviously that-- and also, no, sorry, one thing to add is that it also aligns with the level of ambitions of many Nordic companies. We have heard today already fantastic examples of companies that are extremely ambitious, determined to really make a difference and have very high ambitions in terms of sustainability, and really shown the mechanism of innovation that is needed to strengthen also the EU's competitiveness.

Now we just need to persuade all the ones that are skeptical, who think otherwise, that in the long run, that is the right path to go. And the problem is, of course, when we look at circularity, that we are in a way standing still in Europe. If you look at the level of circularity that we have, or in the world even, it's barely above 10%. And the Commission rightly points to goals like 25% in a reasonably short span of time. How do we do that?

Well, obviously we need to tackle all these barriers that have been mentioned: finance, better regulation, and simply fixed demand, so to say. How do we create more demand and make the market work for us? And all this calls for the drastic measures that the commission has put on the table.

And this is where I think the Nordics may be-- sorry to say so, dear colleagues-- I think we are sometimes, and I talk about myself as a Nordic person in this context, **we are a bit shy**. We sometimes look too much at getting things right at home. And I think that we also, at a political level, should engage more with the other Europeans and try to convince them that the things that the commission has proposed are really good and ambitious. So we have to not only adopt them, we also have to implement them.

### The European Circular Economy Stakeholder Platform

And then let me add one thing, one consistent advice or recommendation that you always hear when you talk about how can you make the circular transition take place is the need for stakeholder collaboration. And also here, let me just put on the European perspective here, because I am representing the business members of the Economic and Social Committee on the steering committee that we have together with the commission for driving the **European Circular Economy Stakeholder Platform**.

And in a way, I would say this is a platform that has been working since 2017 and has grown and grown and grown. I'm sure many of you know it. And it does exactly what we have already discussed many times today: connect the dots, connect the actors, learn from each other and all of this. It puts, let's say, this into practice at a European level.

And that would be my second encouragement to everyone here is to **don't stay in a corner and only look at the Nordic perspective**. It's, of course, extremely important to have hubs and platforms and all of this also at a regional level. But it would be fantastic and valuable for also Europe if all the good things that are taking place in a Nordic context that you all represent were more visible on the EESC platform. And it is very easy to use it. It is very easy to help us, let's say, enrich with all the examples from the Nordic companies and the Nordic stakeholders.

And I'm sure Europe could learn something from it more widely and maybe also the other way around. So that would be my, I really encourage you to do that. So we can, let's say, get there to the 25% and scale it like we want. If we only stay in the corner, we will not scale the whole thing. Thank you.

### Follow-up: From "Why" to "How"

**Alisa Mick**: Yes. So you invite, it's invitation for, of course, for stakeholders to join the platform. Maybe a follow-up question, because you are representing the Confederation of the Danish industry. So in our preparation call, you said something that was very positive. I think it's good to hear also positive things that, as you see, many companies-- and you mentioned that also now when you spoke-- **they are not anymore so much focused on the why, but on the how, how to become more circular**. So kind of, how does this shift look in practice? Because it's quite a new thing. Like a few years ago, we still had to explain why. So now we are in the next stage, I hope.

**Anders Ladefoged**: Well, so do I. But I think it's about, in a way, political leadership, you can say. I mean, of course we need the initiatives from the politicians to say, this is the long-term vision, these are the targets, this is the way to go, you can count on that. Companies, this is predictable goal that we have set here and you will benefit from fulfilling it.

But the problem is that when you then look at it, and we actually did that together with Boston Consulting Group and made an analysis, what will it take for Europe to become more sustainable in transport, energy, circularity, and then you realize that there are not only regulatory deficiencies, so to say, but also **an investment gap that is huge**.

And we have actually tried in this 40-page document to really pinpoint it and say, where is it, what will it cost, how much money needs to go where, and which regulatory measures are needed alongside. And when I read it, I was actually a little bit impressed because in this document, **we call for off-take guarantees, floor prices, more public procurement, binding requirements for recycled content and products**, and things that are actually quite far-reaching.

But that's what it will take to do it in practice. And I am a little bit proud to say that the companies in our federation have actually endorsed this call. And you could say that, well, when a company is starting to call for things like this, it means that **they are on board**.

### Question 2: The Banking Perspective - Value Creation

**Alisa Mick**: Yeah. And you mentioned the investment gap, and maybe it's a good kind of point to now to move to Luca. **What is your kind of perspective from the clients that you're working with in the bank? Do you see the shift also?**

**Luca De Lorenzo**: Yeah, thank you. And thanks. Pleasure to be here. There were some really cool presentations this morning. I will bring a little bit of realistic banking boredom to the room. That's my role, I think, and talk about finance.

So I represent Nordic Investment Bank. We are about 45 billion balance sheet, 4 billion euros a year of lending, just to give you a size. And what we support is productivity, competitiveness type of projects, and sustainable environment. So that's what we do.

So your question, I think, you know, the realistic-- I think it was very nice this morning. You started with value creation, I think, right? And that is fundamental from a financier's perspective, right? **Money goes where value is created. It's as simple as that.**

And if you don't have a strong business case and a strong value creation proposition, you will get some money. You will not get a lot of money. It's simple. So if we want to scale it up, we need to have the value there.

### The Structural Shift: Value of Resilience

The good news is that I think we are going-- or what we observe, at least, and then I'll come to concrete examples with our clients. But I think **there is a structural shift at a macro level in terms of supply chains** and so on. And that is that **the value of resilience has increased**.

Compared to 10, 15 years ago, if we were running a big corporation, what you would do you would optimize your supply chain purely on cost. The cheapest is the best. And so what happened, of course, it primarily went to Asia. I mean, that's a very simplified economic lesson.

Now the trust and the dependencies that we have-- and you've mentioned a few and we discussed-- are critical. They don't work always. And that has a value. **It means that shortening supply chains has a value. And we can put a dollar or a euro sign or a kroner sign to it, right?**

And the moment you do that, the business case and the value for circularity models suddenly increases. And **this is structural. This is structural. It's not going to go away** even if we get a bit more peace, which we all hope for and all of that. The fundamental trust in the market is broken.

So I think this is structural. And this is a big help for circular models. I hope, if anything, this is the key message. And we see that as financiers. That means that these businesses, these type of solutions, suddenly become much more interesting to finance. That's basically it.

### Concrete Examples: Nordic Projects

And what we see then with our clients is that we see some of that actually taking place. And we have some fractions. I mean, in the Nordics, we have worked, maybe just to mention a few:

**In Denmark**, with **FERC**-- it's called FERC. It's plastic recycling in simple, but they actually do food containing the thing. So they own that. They own the recycling, and we finance them. It's actually a pretty interesting element, where you start even seeing a little bit of product design integration with the material recycling. But we'll get to that.

**In Nordics**, we also see a lot of **green steel** happening. So critical raw material, maybe not. Steel is quite a commodity, not yet. There are much more critical materials. But I think it's an indication of what we could do. So we are greening the steel sectors in Sweden, in Finland. **OtoKumpu is recycling steel up to 70% scrap** and using electric arc furnaces. We are part of their journey.

But again, that's just one material, one metal. I think you can see that happening for other more critical metals. You will always need a feed of virgin. So we always need a little bit of mining. But again, mining in our region is relatively costly, right? Again, that's why we have shut them down and we have put mining somewhere else.

So again, circularity of these metals makes value sense in our economies, right? So again, my main message is **the importance and the value of resilience and autonomy increases the business case for circular models**. We are starting to see it. You mentioned there is much more potential, but it needs to be value creation, and then the financing will come.

### Question 3: Long-term Coordination

**Alisa Mick**: Great, thank you. And now again, I think it's a great point to move to Patrick, because in a recent article, a very interesting one, you mentioned, and I'm now reading a quote, that **"while other actors may seek to prioritize short-term financial gains or resource competition over long-term stability. It is crucial for both the climate and regional cooperation that the EU avoid these temptations. Economic ambitions need to be matched by coordinated approaches to climate security, emerging risks and long-term stability in a rapidly changing Arctic."**

So from your perspective, **what does such a coordination look like?** And again, very small question, I know, and we don't have much time, but it will be great to hear.

**Patrick Schroeder**: Great. Thanks for the question and thanks for inviting me to join. It's great to be here in Nuuk, great to be back with the Nordic Circular Summit. I joined in 2022 and then joining that was in Stockholm and now joining here again.

Just wanted to add to the previous topic. So **the circular economy from our analysis that we do, it's definitely a policy-driven transformation**. So the policies that the EU has put in place, the targets in particular, all of that is really important. And to give investment certainty, to show the direction of travel, so we do need to keep this.

And we see that also in some other analysis that we do where we look at **national roadmaps, national circular economy strategies**, so that's some work we've been doing with UNIDO. We published a stock take last year and there were **75 national roadmaps across the world** and we're doing an update this year and there's more. So it's an ongoing policy trend that we see internationally. So many other regions also joining and that links to the next question on these partnerships.

### Long-term Partnerships

So it's again to make circularity work, including also for resilience. We do want to have local systems that are locally rooted, which is also good for local economies, local companies, but there are still these partnerships that we need. And I think that's where the value also of these international dialogues, the long-term perspective is.

It also relates to the critical raw materials where Europe is developing also strategic partnerships, and **these need to be long-term**. And especially to build in circularity into these value chains requires more than, I think, normal commitment, more than normal trade deals. And so that's where, again, coming to the long-term vision, all this is needed.

**Alisa Mick**: Great, thank you. And, yeah, sorry.

**Patrick Schroeder**: Just to finish because I think I mentioned the climate risk. So these **border issues around stability of climate systems, ecosystems, all that needs still to be considered when we talk about competitiveness, when we talk about resilience**. So it's a much more holistic picture that needs to be included into policymaking.

And the risk is, I think we talked about this before, that you mentioned the politics, that these are disrupted by more short-term focused policies, politics, sorry.

### Arctic Perspective: EU Program Complexity

**Alisa Mick**: Yes, and Anders, you are the commission's Arctic rapporteur, so kind of **could you bring your perspective on that, specifically on the Arctic region**, related to what we spoke now?

**Anders Ladefoged**: Well, I would say when we produced our report on Arctic policy, the EU's Arctic policy. We, of course, followed the logic behind the strategy of the Commission from '21. And we can certainly subscribe to all the ideas there, but if I may add something which I'm not sure the Commission might necessarily agree with, but it was something that we heard throughout when we prepared the report, talking to stakeholders from civil society in the Arctic, so all the organizations and businesses and even local authorities who had to, let's say, use what EU provides, also in terms of funds and programs, and here I might also be saying something that you don't agree with, but I think we heard quite consistently that people were saying **for small entities in the Arctic with limited resources, a lot of the programs and other things that EU provides, as good as they, well intentioned they are, are extremely complicated**.

**It's complicated to apply, it's complicated to report**, and there was a general wish, almost a sigh, for saying, yes, we want to engage in all this, but we need it to be a little more simply, simple, a little more unbureaucratic, a little more adapted to an Arctic context.

And I think that is really important if you want to make the locally rooted perspective fit with what comes from so far away as Brussels, both in terms of policy and in terms of tools, so to say.

**Alisa Mick**: Yes, and I have more questions, but now, yeah.

### Indigenous Rights and FPIC

**Keira Dignan**: Now I will pass. Just to squeeze, I know we're running close to the end of time, but I'm gonna try squeeze a little bit more out of this discussion. I want to pick up where we left off, talking about local stakeholders.

We know that in our region **a lot of the critical minerals are located in indigenous lands**, either in the north of Sweden, Finland, Norway, in Sápmi, also in Greenland. We know that there are excellent frameworks available for, for example, **the UN's free prior informed consent (FPIC)**. But over the last 20, 30 years, we have across the board seen **inadequate application of free prior informed consent from indigenous communities for mining**.

And it's becoming increasingly clear that this is a framework or other frameworks are needing to get consent from indigenous communities who are nearby. And this is a real opportunity because we know that **80% of the world's biodiversity is located in lands that are stewarded by indigenous peoples**. So it's an important thing to get right.

So I'm wondering from any of you, **what do you think that companies could do, or what kind of legislative frameworks do we need to make this working with indigenous communities work better for extraction and mining in our region?**

### Value Redistribution and Accountability

**Luca De Lorenzo**: I had, actually-- I was at COP last week. And by the way, if you are moving from 35 degrees humid to here, it's an interesting experience. But anyways, and I was on a panel on just transition, now slightly different. But, you know, and there, of course, a lot of indigenous topics as well, right? I mean, the Amazon forest and so on.

I would say two things. I go back to, there are the frameworks, we should apply them. You know, we as a bank, whenever we finance this, and it's also wind farms, by the way, and herding, you know, there are many projects that we can get in trouble or interact with local communities.

I say two things, basically. One, I go back to this **value creation concept**. So the idea is, if you do transition, if you do go there, there should be a value creation. What is important is **redistribution of that value creation**. We need to have a way so that that value creation doesn't only go to the project or to the corporate that goes there, but **there is a good mechanism to redistribute that value**.

I think, generally speaking, that's a value that we have in the Nordics, and not always as shared across the globe. But it's fundamental, because it's only through **inclusiveness and well-functioning societies** that you can actually get the change in the longer term perspective.

The second one is maybe a little bit more controversial. I would like to hear your opinion. But I think if you think about the transition, the kind of change that we need is massive. It means it will have social consequences. It could be with an indigenous community. To be honest, it can even be in an urban environment or in a sector that we are transitioning away. You've got lots of job issues and social issues relating to that.

So the change will inevitably have social collateral effects. And there, I use the word **accountability**. So the one instigating the change needs to have the accountability to make sure that everybody's heard and that the change is not shoved down the throat. Good. We agree on that.

But there is also a little bit of accountability from the community to understand a little bit the bigger picture, make sure that they get a chunk of the value creation and they're part of it. But they also have to understand the need for the change and somehow embrace it. And I know it's not easy, but that's what I'm trying to, you know, that's what I mean, it's a bit controversial, but I think **everybody in that has the accountability** in order to try and implement the change, whatever the change is.

**Keira Dignan**: And do either of you want to come in on that?

### Race to the Bottom Risk

**Patrick Schroeder**: Yeah, can I add? Yeah, so I agree with the point that you made before. I think **indigenous communities, indigenous voices have been neglected for many, many years**. And I just participated in one of UNEP's Global Environment Outlook assessments. And it's a scientific assessment, but they changed the process that it was not only scientists who participate, but they brought in indigenous communities. So every chapter had one or two representatives from indigenous communities who did not have a scientific background, but brought in their **traditional indigenous knowledge**, which changed many of the discussions. So that was very valuable.

But now, internationally, politically, I think there's the danger that **the scramble for critical minerals leads to a race to the bottom**. So you might get very keen US companies. We know Trump administration is driving this quite strongly now. You might get other companies from China involved in mining, or even increasingly the Middle East companies are investing, that **they do not look at ESG or indigenous rights**.

So then the big question for European companies is **can we still maintain this prior informed consent? Are we able to pay maybe a higher price?** Yeah, **we have to**.

**Luca De Lorenzo**: We have to, come on. Sorry.

**Patrick Schroeder**: Yeah, yeah, so it's a-- No, it's a rhetorical question. So, right, I think this, yeah, to say more directly, **we need to do this. And despite the, let's say, international pressure that we might have**.

**Luca De Lorenzo**: Correct. Yeah.

### Dialogue as Opportunity

**Anders Ladefoged**: Can I add two sentences? Well, I agree, of course, Europe and all of us need to apply the legal standards and rules and best practices that are there. But I think it's also important, and I think we managed to do that in our report, to say, well, **the decisions that are made and the solutions that are implemented will be better if they involve input from the people who actually live and work in the Arctic**.

There are **around four million globally living and working in the Arctic**. Some of them are indigenous, some are not. But the thing is, **if you talk to these people, they all have their vision** of how their local environment could be improved, how you could get attractive jobs, study what you want, get the facilities that you need to want to stay there and live there.

And I think that whatever decision needs to be taken, it really getting a lot better if you just talk to the people who live and work there, who know what is missing, what works, what doesn't work, and not come with your ready-made solutions top-down, that **this dialogue is not just something that should be seen as an obligation, it should also be seen as an opportunity**.

## Part 4: Closing Reflections - Arctic Solidarity and the ArcCirc Vision
**Time**: 13:26 - 13:30 (4 minutes)
**Speakers**: Keira Dignan, Cathrine Barth

### Session Summary

**Keira Dignan**: I think I don't need to double-mic, but I like the idea. And with that, unfortunately, we're out of time. So I think this is a conversation that we can continue on into the breaks, and particularly with hearing from different perspectives around the region, and particularly from our friends here in Nuuk in Greenland. But for now, I'm going to thank our panellists and thank my co-moderator, Alisa, for your thoughts. And I'll invite Cathrine Barth up to the stage to close out this session. Thank you so much.

So, **what I'm hearing from this session** is that we are seeing this moment of geopolitical tension is opening up a moment of opportunity in that **it's fracturing trust in global markets and giving an opportunity for us to localise our economies and thereby create more resilient economies** and to create more locally circular economies.

I'm also hearing that there are some fantastic frameworks out there legislatively available from the EU level, and the Nordics are doing particularly well at implementing these, but that sometimes **we have a lot of competing competitive frameworks, and that that can create challenges for local actors**.

And I was particularly interested in that final discussion we were able to have about **involving local communities in a just transition, and particularly consulting with indigenous communities who are affected**.

Cathrine, what are your thoughts?

### The ArcCirc Vision

**Cathrine Barth**: It has been quite remarkable listening for, I would say, **institutional approaches. Very strong, very committed** from both from Sitra, which is really dedicated to spreading the circularity from Helsinki to the world, but also listening how much emphasis which is going now on the global south.

So that leaves us **what is the Arctic point of view** and what is the opportunity as we also see, we also listen from the Nordic Investment Bank, which is really covering our area. So how do we secure, that **we're not left in a linear lock-in and being out on the limbs**.

So being reminded **the Arctic community is actually quite a large nation, if you put in that terms, with 4 million people**. This is also another approach that I was thinking, seeing the opportunity window that is growing around us now. We both with the legislative coming very much from Europe. We all know who are not in the room today because there are quite many of us who are in Brussels, talking about similar topics. This is not a one-off at all. **This is a major shift**, as we have heard.

Also, knowing there is a long-term initiative leveraging the role of materials, **we haven't been so aware of where materials come from, how we keep them in the economy**. This is also very interesting. We have acknowledged the initiative from Chatham House, and listening Patrick Schroeder, really remembering how do we understand the role of **material economics, the material independency, the material rights, material ownership**, and what we also heard, **material journeys**.

So we heard also from Sitra, maybe it's the **digital product passport**, which will really makes us aware that **every material, whatever, even if they have a history, they come from somewhere and they are going to live possibly forever**. And that's quite another view of the economic reality.

So for my own sake, I was thinking when I listened to Mika, and I know how important actually Sitra has been for the Nordic and European awareness, and being inspired how the solidarity of establishing the EU CERC engaging with Global South.

**I would really think, how could it be if we go together and establish an ArcCirc?**

So, **what is maybe the Arctic solidarity or Arctic collaboration approach?** I know these are the first of many dialogues during these two days, and tomorrow we will really also dig down into the material agency, how do we collaborate about materials, And this is, I would say, a newborn topic. So we have to be a little bit clumsy, a little bit large and forgiving. And we have to really also really embrace these topics **because they connect us**.

**Keira Dignan**: Thank you, Cathrine. And with that, we conclude this session on Locally Rooted. And we will be back for the next session at 45 minutes past after a quick break. Thank you.

## Key Takeaways

### 1. Critical Materials as Security Issue
- Circularity is no longer just environmental - it's about competitiveness and security
- Europe's dependency on China for critical materials is a strategic vulnerability
- EU Critical Raw Materials Act targets: 10% extraction, 40% processing, 25% recycling by 2030

### 2. Mining + Circularity: Both Needed
- "We cannot mine our way out of this dependency"
- Both responsible mining and circularity are necessary
- Circularity must define the long-term path

### 3. Inner Loops Over Recycling
- Strongest benefits from reuse, repair, refurbishment, re-manufacturing
- ESPR (Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation) is critical
- Europe's remanufacturing market: 31B → 100B euros by 2030 (500,000 jobs)

### 4. Structural Shift: Value of Resilience
- Supply chains optimized on cost → now optimizing for resilience
- "Shortening supply chains has a value we can put a dollar sign to"
- This is structural and permanent, not temporary

### 5. Investment Gap and Mechanisms
- Huge investment gap identified (Danish industry + BCG analysis)
- Need: off-take guarantees, floor prices, public procurement, recycled content requirements
- Companies shifting from "why circular" to "how to implement"

### 6. Long-term Partnerships Over Trade Deals
- Policy-driven transformation requires stable, long-term vision
- 75+ national circular economy roadmaps globally
- Strategic partnerships need more than normal trade commitments

### 7. Indigenous Rights and FPIC
- 80% of world's biodiversity in indigenous-stewarded lands
- FPIC inadequately applied over past 20-30 years
- Risk of "race to the bottom" in critical minerals scramble
- Value redistribution and accountability essential

### 8. Arctic Perspective
- 4 million people in Arctic region - a "large nation"
- EU programs well-intentioned but extremely complicated for small Arctic entities
- Need: simpler, less bureaucratic, Arctic-adapted approaches
- Dialogue with local communities is opportunity, not just obligation

### 9. Material Economics Awareness
- Material independency, rights, ownership, journeys
- Digital Product Passport will make material histories visible
- Materials "live possibly forever" - new economic reality

### 10. The ArcCirc Vision
- Inspired by EU CERC (engaging with Global South)
- Proposal: **ArcCirc - Arctic Circular Economy Resource Centre**
- Arctic solidarity and collaboration approach
- Material agency and collaboration as connecting force
