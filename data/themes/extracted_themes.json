Communication and content is key, where culture is key to understand in a place-based approach with contextual and cultural understanding.

We essentially come from a place where how can I construct any piece of equipment or whatever in a robust way that I ensure that I'm also able to maintain? Because our survival essentially depends on it.\"\n\n**Old Time vs. New Time**:\n- Assumption: old time = industrialization, new time = what's ahead\n- But: new time description = very, very old time in Greenlandic/Arctic sense\n- Circular principles are pre-industrial Arctic practices\n- \"How do we make use of what we have without restricting future generations?\"\n\n**Remote Area Robust Design**:\n- Often building where carpenter won't come by next week\n- Important to have robust solutions\n- High level of detail required\n- Context varies enormously (Nuuk metropolis vs. 50-person settlement)\n\n**Population Scale Reality**:\n- Greenland: 0.00068% of world population\n- Complete Arctic: 0.05% of world population\n- Implication: Don't focus on innovating new high-tech materials\n- Focus on utilizing applications of available materials\n- Traditional practices provide insights for global circular economy\n\n**Design for Disassembly - Personal Story**:\n- Father born 1945 in small settlement\n- When visiting birthplace decades later: \"Where's the house?\"\n- Aunt's answer: \"The house, we brought it.\"\n- Traditional construction = design for disassembly\n- Reusable in other settings as needs change\n\n**Renovation Economics Example**:\n- Lack of maintenance catching up now\n- Positive: increased focus on maintenance, renovation, transformation\n- Disko Bay housing blocks: strip to main construction, refurbish\n- **About half the cost of new building**\n- Structural parts = largest CO2 (especially concrete)\n- Therefore: pursue renovation more\n\n---"

This also includes that we're not gonna, at least for now, put in some legislation concerning sustainability. We should be able to do this together and agree on all of those things.\"\n\n- Holistic approach across entire sector\n- Reliance on collective agreement, not top-down mandates\n- Community trust enables consensus\n\n**Three Guiding Principles**:\n1. Sustainability (incl. CO2 reduction) = active, permanent element of all government construction projects\n2. Create healthy, high-quality buildings benefiting society and users for future generations\n3. Shared understanding of sustainability established across the sector\n\n**Purpose**:\n- Launch sector-wide dialogue for future direction\n- Support more sustainable development in practice\n- \"In practice in Greenland is sometimes a bit challenging\"\n- Create common foundation for entire industry to build together\n\n**Vision**:\n- Construction sector operates with consideration for future generations\n- **\"The needs of the present must be met without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs\"**\n- Must: develop sustainable/innovative solutions\n- Must: contribute to growth throughout country\n- Must: reflect Greenland's culture and support local communities\n- Must: contribute to better climate and environment\n- Must: take global responsibility and participate in global developments\n\n\"It's a very strong vision for a small industry\"\n\n**Six Goals** (intentionally limited):\n1. Government (as public developer) actively contributes through holistic approach\n2. Sector establishes joint forum for dialogue and cooperation\n3. Develop systematic methods/tools to measure sustainability and emissions\n4. Determine environmental/climate impact, set targets, reduce emissions\n5. Jointly define objectives and initiatives for sustainable constructions\n6. (Sixth implied in overall implementation)\n\n> \"It's not many goals, which is also our purpose. It should be goals that we can actually meet.\"\n\n**Seven Concrete Initiatives**:\n1. Principles for sustainability\n2. Prioritization of art and architecture in government projects\n3. Development of national DGNB system (certification)\n4. Development of shared LCA methodology\n5. Establishment of Council for Sustainability within construction sector\n6. Preparation of CO2 emissions action plan\n7. (Seventh related to monitoring/communication)\n\n**Implementation Progress**:\n- **DGNB system**: Well underway, December conference for final dialogue\n- **Government approach**: Will use DGNB standard but NOT get certification\n  - \"It doesn't really give anything of value to us\"\n  - But needs to be in place for private projects\n- **LCA methodology**: December presentation\n- **Council for Sustainability**: Established 2023, held two meetings\n  - Main discussion: how to get to CO2 action plan\n  - **Challenge: \"We don't have any data at the moment\"**\n  - Need to start somewhere, building baseline\n\n---"
