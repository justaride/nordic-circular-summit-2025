    "content": "🏙️ From Place to Planet: Building Circular Futures\n\nSession 5 of #NordicCircularSummit brought together leaders from Riga, Cesis, Oslo, and Greenland to explore place-based circular city development.\n\n🔑 THREE CRITICAL PATTERNS:\n\n1️⃣ **RETROFIT FIRST = ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY**\n• London: regulatory requirement (2020) completely changed the scene\n• Oslo: transformations are \"best practices in real estate development\"\n• Greenland Disko Bay: renovation = ~50% cost of new construction\n• Structural reuse = massive CO2 savings (especially concrete)\n\n2️⃣ **CIRCULAR PROCUREMENT = LEVERAGE POINT**\n• Riga: circular construction guidelines in all procurement\n• Riga: material banks for departments to share assets\n• Cesis: organic food procurement for schools/kindergartens\n• \"The procurement muscle\" shapes markets, not just purchases\n\n3️⃣ **TRUST + COMMUNITY = FOUNDATION**\n• Greenland: no mandatory legislation, collective agreement instead\n• Cesis: memorandum of goodwill with 13 institutions (1 year to craft)\n• Riga: 108 speakers, 34 sessions at first Circular Economy Forum\n\n💬 THE QUOTE:\n\"For the most important thing you have to build when you build places is trust. If you don't have trust, you don't manage to create any good place.\"\n— Einar Kleppe Holthe, Natural State, Norway\n\n🌍 KEY SPEAKERS:\n• Einar Kleppe Holthe (Natural State, Norway) - Place economy principles\n• Tālis Linkaits (Riga Energy Agency, Latvia) - EU Mission Label city\n• Inese Suija-Markova (Cesis/Vidzeme, Latvia) - First Baltic bioregion\n• Inooraq Brandt (Rambøll Greenland) - Arctic construction wisdom\n• Helle Redder Momsen (Nordic Sustainable Construction) - LCA harmonization\n• Embla Kristjánsdóttir (Greenland Ministry) - National strategy\n\n📊 NORDIC 2030 VISION:\n\"Within five years, the Nordic countries have this vision of being the most sustainable and integrated region in the world.\"\n\nThe tools exist. The examples exist. The economic case exists.\n\nThe question is execution—and that depends on trust.\n\n#CircularEconomy #CircularCities #Riga #Greenland #NordicCooperation #RetrofitFirst #CircularProcurement #PlaceEconomy #Sustainability",

    "content": "🌲 THE FIRST BALTIC BIOREGION: Cesis, Latvia\n\n\"We cannot excel in every area being all alone. By working together, small regions can achieve more than they could ever do in isolation.\"\n— Inese Suija-Markova, Deputy Mayor of Cesis & Regional Mayor of Vidzeme\n\n📍 **CONTEXT:**\n• 90 km northeast of Riga\n• Vidzeme region: beautiful landscape, forests, meadows, clean air\n• Deep sense of community, strong cultural traditions\n• But: sparse population, aging demographic, limited economic scale\n\n💡 **THE SOLUTION: BIOREGION**\n\nOctober 2023: Four municipalities + farmers + NGOs + entrepreneurs + researchers + residents\n\n**What is a bioregion?**\n\"NOT an administrative unit. A geographic and cultural space where public authorities, farmers, tourism operators, businesses and citizens AGREE to manage local resources sustainably based on ecological principles and shared responsibility.\"\n\nIn essence: **A SOCIAL CONTRACT.**\n\n📜 **MEMORANDUM OF GOODWILL:**\n• Crafted over ONE YEAR\n• Every word agreed by stakeholders\n• 13 institutions: public, private, NGO, academic\n• Public commitment to create cleaner, healthier, circular region\n• 6 principles for working together\n• 8 working directions\n\n🎯 **EIGHT PRIORITY AREAS:**\n1. Healthy, organic food access\n2. Short food supply chains\n3. Natural capital management (ecosystem services)\n4. Waste reduction\n5. Energy efficiency & renewables\n6. Sustainability education\n7. Authentic, nature-friendly tourism\n8. (Implementation details)\n\n✅ **THREE PRACTICAL EXAMPLES:**\n\n**1. Organic Food in Schools/Kindergartens**\n• Transform procurement system\n• Local, organic ingredients replace anonymous supply chains\n• First organically certified school kitchen in Latvia (in progress)\n• Reduced emissions + healthier food + local economic value\n\n**2. Circular Economy Center at Landfill**\n• Different concept: waste as resource\n• Develop new products from waste streams\n• Transformation, not just disposal\n\n**3. Financial Instruments + LEADER Integration**\n• Municipal grants for circular businesses\n• Integrated bioregion principles into LEADER program (EU rural funding)\n• Mainstreamed into funding strategies = \"great success\"\n\n🌍 **THE PHILOSOPHY:**\n\"A strategic alliance based on shared values and really the aim to be in touch with the nature, to live in accordance with the nature, to respect the environment where we live.\"\n\n🔑 **KEY LESSON:**\nRural challenges (population, scale, resources) become innovation drivers.\n\nCooperation > competition.\nPlace-based > one-size-fits-all.\nVoluntary agreement > top-down mandate.\n\nThis is circular economy at its most integrated.\n\n#CircularEconomy #Bioregion #RuralDevelopment #Cesis #Latvia #OrganicFood #ShortSupplyChains #SocialContract #PlaceBasedDevelopment #NordicCircularSummit",

    "title": "Greenland's Trust-Based Strategy: No Legislation Required",
    "content": "🇬🇱 GREENLAND: Trust Over Legislation\n\nMost countries mandate sustainability through regulation.\n\nGreenland chose a different path.\n\n📋 **NATIONAL SUSTAINABILITY STRATEGY (2024):**\nFor construction and civil engineering sector.\n\nBut here's what makes it unique:\n\n💬 **THE CORE DECISION:**\n\"We must succeed together. This also includes that we're not gonna, at least for now, put in some legislation concerning sustainability. We should be able to do this together and agree on all of those things.\"\n— Embla Kristjánsdóttir, Ministry for Housing, Infrastructure and Outer Districts\n\n**WHY THIS WORKS:**\n• Small industry\n• Strong sense of community\n• Lot of trust between all working in industry\n• Geographic, climatic, logistical uniqueness\n\n🎯 **THE APPROACH:**\nHolistic approach to sustainability across entire sector.\n\nNot top-down mandates.\nCollective agreement enabled by community trust.\n\n**THREE GUIDING PRINCIPLES:**\n1. Sustainability = active element in ALL government construction projects\n2. Create healthy, high-quality buildings for future generations\n3. Shared understanding of sustainability across the sector\n\n**SIX GOALS** (intentionally limited):\n\"It's not many goals, which is also our purpose. It should be goals that we can actually meet.\"\n\n**SEVEN CONCRETE INITIATIVES:**\n• Principles for sustainability\n• Art & architecture prioritization\n• National DGNB system development\n• Shared LCA methodology\n• Council for Sustainability establishment\n• CO2 emissions action plan\n• (Monitoring/communication)\n\n🏗️ **DGNB APPROACH:**\n\"The government is not gonna do certified projects. We're gonna go with the DGNB standard, but we're not gonna get the certification. It doesn't really give anything of value to us.\"\n\nUse standard = yes.\nBureaucratic certification = no.\n\nBut it needs to exist for private projects.\n\n📊 **THE CHALLENGE:**\n\"We don't have any data at the moment.\"\n\nCouncil meetings focus on: how do we get to CO2 action plan without baseline data?\n\nAnswer: Start somewhere. Build baseline during implementation.\n\n🔍 **WHAT THIS DEMONSTRATES:**\n\n✅ Trust can replace (or supplement) mandatory legislation\n✅ Small groups with strong relationships move faster\n✅ Social contracts work where community is strong\n✅ Vision can be ambitious even with limited resources\n✅ Honesty about challenges (no data) builds credibility\n✅ Goals should be achievable, not overwhelming\n\n💡 **THE INSIGHT:**\nRegulation is ONE tool for sustainability.\n\nBut in the right context, with the right culture:\n\nTrust + collective agreement + shared framework = powerful alternative.\n\n🌍 **TRANSFERABLE LESSONS:**\n• Start with dialogue before regulation\n• Leverage existing community trust\n• Be honest about data limitations\n• Set achievable goals\n• Create forums for cooperation (e.g., Council for Sustainability)\n• Adapt international standards to local context\n\n\"The needs of the present must be met without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.\"\n— Greenland National Strategy vision\n\nThis is intergenerational trust made policy.\n\n#CircularEconomy #Greenland #TrustBasedStrategy #CommunityAgreement #SustainableConstruction #DGNB #Arctic #PolicyInnovation #NordicCircularSummit",

That is why you need to learn how to speak economic, and for instance, circular economic.\"\n— Einar Kleppe Holthe, Natural State, Norway\n\n🔑 KEY PRINCIPLES:\n\n📍 **PLACE MATTERS**\n\"The life of place—city life, village life, neighborhood life—is also the life of our planet, is where you create or you have the activity.\"\n\n🔺 **TRIANGULATE FOR CLARITY**\nPlace + Approach + Topic = Concrete Value Proposition\n\nExample:\n• Place: Oslo\n• Approach: Circular economy\n• Topic: Construction\n= Oslo circular building transformation projects\n\n💰 **ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCE OF AWARENESS**\nUnderstanding effect and cause of our systems → sustainable value creation principles → sustainability economies as languages\n\n🌐 **FOUR VALUE TYPES (NOT JUST ONE)**\n✅ Nature value\n✅ Human value\n✅ Societal value\n✅ Market value\n\nAll four must be described in economic terms.\n\n📊 **THE DYNAMICS:**\n• Dynamics of place = dynamics of values\n• Activity = value of place\n• Values of place = qualities of place\n• Qualities = attractivity\n• Attractivity = identity\n• Identity = quality of life\n\n🤝 **TRUST AS FOUNDATION**\n\"For the most important thing you have to build when you build places is TRUST. If you don't have trust, you don't manage to create any good place.\"\n\n🗣️ **CULTURE IS KEY**\n\"Communication and content is key, where culture is key to understand in a place-based approach with contextual and cultural understanding. If you don't bring that into the proposition, you're losing the value proposition.\"\n\n✨ **FROM THEORY TO PRACTICE:**\n• London: Retrofit first (regulatory, 2020)\n• Oslo: Office → elderly home transformation\n• Rural Norway: Factory → innovation hub\n• Riga: Urban resource centers\n• Cesis: Bioregion memorandum\n• Greenland: Trust-based national strategy\n\n📚 **READ MORE:**\n\"The New Natural State of the Market\" (2022)\nTheory of economic development of place and location.\n\nPlace identity based on sustainable economical activity.\n\nLearn more at nordiccircularsummit.com/transcripts\n\n#PlaceEconomy #CircularEconomy #CircularCities #EconomicDevelopment #SustainabilityEconomics #NaturalState #Oslo #Nuuk #Greenland #NordicCircularSummit #HolisticValue #CommunityTrust #PlaceBasedDevelopment",

So we're trying to catch up on that.\"\n\n**THE POSITIVE SHIFT:**\n\"The larger focus that we are seeing on maintenance and renovation and transformation is very positive.\"\n\nGovernment + municipal levels both pushing.\n\n💡 **WHAT GLOBAL BUSINESSES CAN LEARN:**\n\n1. **Constraints = innovation drivers**\n   If it works in Arctic, it works anywhere\n\n2. **Robust design = essential everywhere**\n   Supply chains increasingly fragile\n   Skilled trades facing labor shortages\n\n3. **Traditional knowledge = modern solutions**\n   Don't reinvent circular economy\n   Learn from those who never abandoned it\n\n4. **Maintenance > new construction**\n   Economic + environmental + social case clear\n\n5. **Population scale doesn't limit impact**\n   0.00068% of world, but leading circular thinking\n\n🌟 **THE META-LESSON:**\n\nWhat industrialization dismissed as \"primitive\" is now recognized as:\n• More durable\n• More maintainable\n• More sustainable\n• More culturally meaningful\n• More economically viable\n\nCircular economy isn't innovation.\n\nIt's RECONNECTION.\n\nTo place. To practice.

    "content": "🏙️ SESSION 5 RECAP: Circular Cities & Regions\n\nFrom Place to Planet: Building Circular Futures\n\nThe final main session of Nordic Circular Summit 2025 in Nuuk, Greenland brought together an incredible range of perspectives on place-based circular city development! 🌍\n\n---\n\n🎤 **OUR SPEAKERS:**\n\n🇳🇴 **Einar Kleppe Holthe** (Natural State, Norway)\nPresented place economy principles and how to speak \"circular economic\"\n\n🇱🇻 **Tālis Linkaits** (Riga Energy Agency, Latvia)\nShared how Riga became one of 100 EU climate neutral cities\n\n🇱🇻 **Inese Suija-Markova** (Cesis & Vidzeme, Latvia)\nExplained the first bioregion in the Baltic States\n\n🇬🇱 **Inooraq Brandt** (Rambøll Greenland)\nBrought Arctic construction wisdom and traditional knowledge\n\n🇩🇰 **Helle Redder Momsen** (Nordic Sustainable Construction)\nDescribed Nordic LCA harmonization and 2030 vision\n\n🇬🇱 **Embla Kristjánsdóttir** (Greenland Ministry)\nPresented Greenland's trust-based national strategy\n\n🇬🇱 **Anne Mette Christiansen** (CSR Greenland / Rambøll)\nProvided closing reflections and synthesis\n\n---\n\n🔑 **THREE CRITICAL PATTERNS:**\n\n**1. RETROFIT FIRST = ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY 💰**\n\n• London 2020: Regulatory requirement to retrofit buildings first completely changed the scene\n• Oslo: Transformations are \"one of best practices in real estate development\"\n• Greenland Disko Bay: Renovation = about HALF the cost of new construction!\n• Keeping structural parts (especially concrete) = massive CO2 savings\n\nThe economic case is clear: renovation isn't just environmental, it's financially smart.\n\n**2. CIRCULAR PROCUREMENT = LEVERAGE POINT 📋**\n\n• Riga: Circular construction guidelines embedded in ALL procurement\n• Riga: Material banks so municipality departments share assets/inventory\n• Cesis: Transforming school/kindergarten food procurement to local, organic\n• Using \"the procurement muscle\" to shape markets, not just purchase\n\nMunicipalities and governments hold enormous market power through procurement!\n\n**3. TRUST + COMMUNITY = FOUNDATION 🤝**\n\n• Greenland: No mandatory legislation—collective agreement based on community trust instead\n• Cesis: Memorandum of goodwill with 13 institutions (took 1 year to craft every word)\n• Riga: First Latvian Circular Economy Forum had 108 speakers and 34 sessions—people so eager to share!\n\n\"For the most important thing you have to build when you build places is trust. If you don't have trust, you don't manage to create any good place.\"\n— Einar Kleppe Holthe\n\n---\n\n✨ **HIGHLIGHTS:**\n\n🇱🇻 **RIGA: CIRCULAR ECONOMY LAB**\n\nEU Mission Label as one of 100 climate neutral cities! Vision: \"A modern driving force for circular economy innovations, a circular economy lab within the country.\"\n\nThree work directions:\n1. Citizen engagement (get back to circular basics)\n2. Municipality resources (embed in procurement, material banks)\n3. Circular businesses (moderate, stimulate, influence—not fund)\n\nPractical examples:\n→ Urban resource center: repair + community hub (EU good practice database!)\n→ Library garden with circular principles (opening spring 2025)\n→ Pre-studies before transformations using circular criteria\n→ Latvian Circular Economy Forum: 108 speakers, 34 sessions\n\nFunding model: Attract EU funds, sponsors, grants (not primarily public funding)\n\n🌲 **CESIS: FIRST BALTIC BIOREGION**\n\n\"We cannot excel in every area being all alone. By working together, small regions can achieve more.\"\n— Inese Suija-Markova\n\nOctober 2023: Four municipalities + farmers + NGOs + entrepreneurs + researchers + residents created the first bioregion in Baltic States.\n\nWhat's a bioregion? NOT an administrative unit. A geographic and cultural space where everyone AGREES to manage resources sustainably based on ecological principles. In essence: A SOCIAL CONTRACT.\n\nMemorandum of goodwill:\n• Crafted over ONE YEAR\n• 13 institutions (public, private, NGO, academic)\n• 6 principles, 8 working directions\n\nExamples:\n→ Organic food in schools (first organically certified school kitchen in Latvia coming!)\n→ Circular economy center at landfill (waste as resource)\n→ Integrated principles into LEADER funding (EU rural development)\n\n🏔️ **ARCTIC CONSTRUCTION WISDOM**\n\n\"The words that come to mind when people describe this new time is actually very much in line with the very, very old time in a Greenlandic or Arctic sense.\"\n— Inooraq Brandt\n\nCircular economy = ancient Arctic practices!\n\nKey principles:\n→ Robust solutions (carpenter won't come by next week)\n→ Design for disassembly (Inooraq's father's house was moved!)\n→ Maintenance-first thinking\n→ Use applications of available materials, not high-tech innovation\n→ \"As a WIC, we can use almost anything\"—survival depends on it\n\nDisko Bay renovation example: Strip to main construction, refurbish = ~50% cost of new building\n\nGreenland population: 0.00068% of world\nBut: leading circular thinking that others can learn from!\n\n📊 **NORDIC LCA COLLABORATION**\n\n\"Within five years, the Nordic countries have this vision of being the most sustainable and integrated region in the world.\"\n— Helle Redder Momsen\n\n2030 = 5 years away!\n\nLCA (Life Cycle Assessment) requirements spreading:\n→ Sweden: First to mandate\n→ Norway: Shortly after\n→ Denmark 2023: Calculate + limit values\n→ Iceland Sept 2024: Joined\n→ Finland 2026: Coming\n→ EU 2028: Buildings >1,000 sqm\n→ EU 2030: All countries plan to 2050\n\nGAME-CHANGER: Reused products in LCA = SET TO ZERO\nNot real number (transport/processing has emissions), but provides political push!\n\nThree work packages: Climate/LCA (Iceland), Circularity (Denmark), EU coordination (Sweden)\n\nPolicy measures catalogue being developed for all Nordic countries.\n\nEducational program: 6 Nordic languages + English, freely available online!\n\n🇬🇱 **GREENLAND: TRUST-BASED STRATEGY**\n\n\"We must succeed together. We're not gonna put in legislation. We should be able to do this together and agree.\"\n— Embla Kristjánsdóttir\n\nNational sustainability strategy (2024) for construction sector:\n→ Small industry with strong community\n→ Lot of trust between all working in industry\n→ Collective agreement, not top-down mandates\n→ Holistic approach across entire sector\n\n6 goals (intentionally limited): \"Should be goals we can actually meet\"\n\n7 concrete initiatives including:\n→ National DGNB system (government will use standard but not get certification)\n→ Shared LCA methodology\n→ Council for Sustainability\n→ CO2 action plan\n\nChallenge: \"We don't have any data at the moment.\"\nAnswer: Start somewhere, build baseline during implementation.\n\nHonesty about challenges builds credibility!\n\n---\n\n💡 **KEY TAKEAWAYS:**\n\n✅ \"The language of this structure is economy, is numbers.\" Learn to speak circular economic!\n\n✅ \"The life of place—city life, village life, neighborhood life—is also the life of our planet.\"\n\n✅ Triangulate: Place + Approach + Topic = Concrete value proposition\n\n✅ Trust must be embedded in transparent structures\n\n✅ Culture shapes behavior more than regulation\n\n✅ Renovation: 50% cost, massive CO2 savings\n\n✅ Circular procurement = market shaping, not just purchasing\n\n✅ Urban-rural knowledge flows = bidirectional (both have wisdom to share)\n\n✅ Scale-appropriate solutions (capital cities to 50-person settlements)\n\n✅ Traditional knowledge + contemporary systems = circular future\n\n---\n\n🌟 **THE BIG PICTURE:**\n\nThe session demonstrated that circular cities are not built by centralized mandates or universal blueprints.\n\nThey emerge from place-based approaches that:\n→ Honor local context\n→ Respect traditional knowledge\n→ Build community trust\n→ Connect to global systems\n→ Speak economic language\n→ Prioritize renovation\n→ Leverage procurement\n→ Enable cooperation\n\nFrom place to planet, one project at a time, one building at a time, one community at a time, one memorandum at a time, one procurement at a time.\n\nThis is how circular cities are built.\n\n---\n\nThank you to everyone in Nuuk and online! 🙏\n\nFull transcripts, articles, and key quotes: nordiccircularsummit.com/transcripts\n\n#CircularEconomy #CircularCities #NordicCircularSummit #Riga #Cesis #Greenland #Latvia #PlaceEconomy #RetrofitFirst #CircularProcurement #CommunityTrust #Arctic #Nordic #Baltic #Nuuk #2030Vision #SustainableConstruction #LCA #Bioregion #TraditionalKnowledge",

    "content": "🏙️ HOW CAN YOUR CITY BECOME CIRCULAR?\n\nWe just wrapped Session 5 at Nordic Circular Summit 2025 with incredible examples from Riga, Cesis, Oslo, and Greenland! 🌍\n\nNow we want to hear from YOU! 💬\n\n---\n\n🤔 **QUESTIONS FOR THE COMMUNITY:**\n\n1️⃣ **RENOVATION vs. NEW CONSTRUCTION**\n\nGreenland is renovating housing blocks at ~50% the cost of building new, with massive CO2 savings.\n\nDoes your city prioritize renovation? What are the barriers? What would help?\n\n2️⃣ **CIRCULAR PROCUREMENT**\n\nRiga embeds circular criteria in ALL procurement. Cesis is transforming school food procurement to local, organic.\n\nWhat could your city/region do with procurement power? Share ideas!\n\n3️⃣ **TRUST-BASED vs. REGULATION-BASED**\n\nGreenland chose collective agreement over mandatory legislation, relying on community trust.\n\nWhich approach works better in your context? Why?\n\n4️⃣ **URBAN RESOURCE CENTERS**\n\nRiga's repair facility + community center model is spreading.\n\nDoes your city have something similar? Would you use one? What should it include?\n\n5️⃣ **BIOREGION CONCEPT**\n\nCesis created the first Baltic bioregion: voluntary agreement among municipalities, farmers, businesses, NGOs to manage resources sustainably.\n\nCould this work in your region? What would be the biggest challenge?\n\n6️⃣ **TRADITIONAL KNOWLEDGE**\n\nArctic communities practiced circular economy for millennia (necessity, not trend).\n\nWhat traditional circular practices exist in YOUR community that have been forgotten?\n\n---\n\n💡 **KEY INSIGHTS TO CONSIDER:**\n\n✅ \"The most important thing you have to build when you build places is trust.\" — Einar Kleppe Holthe\n\n✅ \"We cannot excel in every area being all alone. By working together, small regions can achieve more.\" — Inese Suija-Markova\n\n✅ \"The words that come to mind when people describe this new time is actually very much in line with the very, very old time in a Greenlandic sense.\" — Inooraq Brandt\n\n✅ \"Within five years, the Nordic countries have this vision of being the most sustainable and integrated region in the world.\" — Helle Redder Momsen\n\n---\n\n🌟 **WHAT WE LEARNED:**\n\n→ Circular cities need ECONOMIC language (numbers that describe nature, human, societal, market values)\n→ Retrofit first = economic opportunity, not just environmental\n→ Circular procurement = enormous municipal leverage\n→ Trust + community = foundation for all good places\n→ Place-based approaches > universal blueprints\n→ Traditional knowledge = modern circular solutions\n→ Urban-rural knowledge flows = bidirectional\n→ Scale-appropriate (capital cities to 50-person settlements)\n\n---\n\n💬 **SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS:**\n\nComment below with:\n• What your city/region is doing (or could do)\n• Barriers you're facing\n• Traditional practices that should return\n• Creative ideas for circular urban development\n• Questions about any of the examples shared\n\nLet's learn from each other! 🤝\n\nThe transition to circular cities happens through community dialogue, knowledge sharing, and collective action.\n\nYour voice matters. Your experience matters. Your place matters.\n\nBecause as we learned today:\n\"The life of place—city life, village life, neighborhood life—is also the life of our planet.\"\n\nFrom place to planet.
