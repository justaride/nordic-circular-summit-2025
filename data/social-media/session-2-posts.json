Iceland went from using 45% of each fish to over 90%.\n\nThe methodology is transferable:\n✅ Know your species and volumes\n✅ Understand current processing\n✅ Identify properties of side streams\n✅ Assess market opportunities\n✅ Build business cases\n\nWe don't need to reinvent the wheel. The 100% Fish philosophy works—and it scales.\n\nGlobal seafood demand is predicted to nearly double by 2050. We already have the solution in what we currently waste.\n\n#CircularEconomy #Seafood #OceanIndustries #100PercentFish #Sustainability #FoodWaste",

    "content": "🌊 CIRCULAR OCEAN INDUSTRIES - Session 2 Recap from Nuuk!\n\nWhat happens when ocean industry leaders from Iceland, Greenland, Finland, Denmark, and Norway gather to share circular economy breakthroughs?\n\nMagic. 🪄\n\nTOP MOMENTS:\n\n🇮🇸 ICELAND: Alexandra Leeper (Iceland Ocean Cluster) shared how Iceland went from wasting 55% of each fish to utilizing 90%+. Value per cod: $12 → $5,000.\n\n🇬🇱 GREENLAND: Kristian Ottesen (Royal Greenland) revealed how they transformed a shrimp meal factory from losing 800K DKK/year to profitable. Their secret? Cultural buy-in + Nordic partnerships.\n\n🇫🇮 FINLAND: Michaela Lindström (Hylia Nordic) proved side streams are superfood—20x more calcium, 10x more zinc than fillets. 8 products now in retail!\n\n🇩🇰 DENMARK: Linn Indrestrand (Danish Ocean Cluster) explained how logistics determines everything. Quality degrades with each move = price degrades.\n\n🇳🇴 NORWAY: Monika Poulsen (ACT Cluster) with 119 partners showed that solutions lie BETWEEN sectors, not within them.\n\nTHE BIG PICTURE:\n23 million metric tons of edible seafood wasted annually. Global demand doubling by 2050. The solution already exists in what we currently waste.\n\nWe just need to utilize it smarter.\n\nKEY LESSONS:\n✅ 100% Fish methodology is transferable\n✅ Corporate transformation requires culture change\n✅ Side streams have superior nutrition\n✅ Clusters enable at scale\n✅ Cross-sectoral beats single-sector thinking\n✅ Trust infrastructure matters most\n\nThank you to everyone who joined us in Nuuk and online! 🙏\n\nFull transcript and article available at nordiccircularsummit.com/transcripts\n\n#CircularOcean #CircularEconomy #Seafood #NordicCircularSummit #Nuuk #Greenland #Sustainability #OceanIndustries #100PercentFish #RoyalGreenland #IcelandOceanCluster",
