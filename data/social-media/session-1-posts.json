Not the roads.\"\n\nEdvard Lybert Mørk from Nalek Ventures shared this powerful insight at Nordic Circular Summit 2025 in Nuuk.\n\nIn the Arctic, where distances are vast and conditions are extreme, social infrastructure matters more than physical infrastructure.\n\nThis principle applies to circular economy everywhere: we need pre-competitive collaboration frameworks where competitors trust each other enough to work on shared challenges.\n\n🔹 Denmark's Circular Furniture Network: 30 competing brands collaborating\n🔹 Voluntary Sector Collaboration on Textiles\n🔹 Nordic Circular Investments (Finland, Sweden, Norway)\n\nTrust enables the transition. Without it, circular economy stays theoretical.\n\nWhat role does trust play in your circular transition work?",

How is our economy designed? Who gets to make the decisions?\"\n\nYouth organizations across the Nordics are working both:\n→ INSIDE: Advisory boards to Prime Ministers (Generation 2030 Finland)\n→ OUTSIDE: Direct action and activism (NaturUngdom Norway)\n\nThis generation isn't asking for a seat at the kids' table.

Circular investments are seen as more risky because they require more time.\"\n\nThe structural challenge:\n\n🏭 Physical infrastructure needed (factories, logistics)\n📚 Market education required\n🤝 Multi-stakeholder networks take time to build\n⏰ Longer timelines than software solutions\n\nCompare:\n→ Tech startup: Scale fast with code\n→ Circular startup: Build physical systems, educate markets, coordinate supply chains\n\nThe solution isn't to make circular businesses \"faster.\"\n\nIt's to change our investment models.\n\n\"We need NEW TYPES OF INVESTMENT MODELS which bring public investments and private investments together so that we can lower the risk that private investors are currently seeing.\"\n\n— Alisa Mick\n\nExamples emerging:\n🔹 Nordic Circular Investments (Finland, Sweden, Norway)\n🔹 Hybrid public-private funding structures\n🔹 De-risking mechanisms for circular infrastructure\n\nThe question isn't whether circular economy is investable.\n\nIt's whether our investment frameworks are fit for purpose.\n\nAre you rethinking your investment thesis for circular transitions?\n\n#CircularEconomy #Investment #Innovation #Sustainability #NordicCircularSummit #ClimateFinance #ImpactInvesting",
