    "content": "\ud83d\udea8 The textile industry is in crisis.\n\nAnd it's not the one you're thinking of.\n\nAt Nordic Circular Summit 2025, Kerli Kant Hvass from Aalborg University shared a story from 2017:\n\n**The Story:**\n\nA secondhand operator in Estonia had 50 tons of used textiles. No markets. Sent to landfill.\n\nWhy? Their partner was saturated with imports from Scandinavian countries. Local reuse couldn't absorb the volumes.\n\n**The Crisis Today:**\n\n\ud83d\udcbb Ultra-fast fashion: Multiple Shein/Temu planes arrive in Estonia weekly\n\ud83d\udce6 Separate collection mandate (Jan 2025) exposed infrastructure gaps\n\ud83c\udf0d 80% of European textiles exported to Africa and Asia\n\ud83d\udcca Recycling stats misleading: \"88% recycling\" mostly means backfilling\n\n**The Uncomfortable Truth:**\n\n\"The majority of recycling consists of mixed mineral waste used for backfilling \u2014 which doesn't equate to high-value circular use.\"\n\n**What's Being Overlooked:**\n\n\u2192 Preparation for reuse and repair has received almost no attention\n\u2192 Products don't get reused because they're dirty, stained, or pilled\n\u2192 These activities aren't done professionally at scale\n\n**EPR Concerns:**\n\n\ud83d\udd39 Focus on price, not impact\n\ud83d\udd39 Targets missing, unclear, or unambiguous\n\ud83d\udd39 Fees unrealistically low\n\ud83d\udd39 No harmonization across borders\n\n**The Question:**\n\n\"How do we design EPR schemes that fix market failures and enable true cross-border textile circularity?\"\n\nThe answer requires regional collaboration, shared infrastructure, and honest assessment of where we really are.\n\nNot just where we want to be.\n\n#TextileCrisis #CircularTextiles #EPR #FastFashion #NordicCircularSummit #TextileWaste #Sustainability #ReUse",
